_PBIQRCRa0T9N3S3W_1CXA,_QDlxjPJf76c5O9OqY_tqA,4.0,2016-05-19 19:27:50,"I found Cafe 128 on Yelp, looking for another place to add to the lunch rotation, but was still close to my office.  I have to say though, I never would have found it unless someone told me it was there.  It's sort of tucked away in the half underground basement of a building on West State St., right across from the NJ statehouse.  While it felt a little strange walking down the red brick steps, I couldn't help but think that this was what I felt a speakeasy may have been like back in the 20's.  The inside is nicely appointed with modern decor and fixtures.  It was a little darker than I would have guessed, but I think that was a nice selling point for me.  Workers in Trenton are under these bright fluorescent lights in their offices and cubicles all day; what better way to relax on your break than a nice cafe with comfortable/moderate lighting and friendly staff.  

The food was exactly as I had imagined it by reading the description on the menu.  My meal choice for my first time was the Roast Turkey sandwich. It comes topped with sharp cheddar cheese and cranberry mayo to add a hint of sweetness.  The turkey was well cooked and not dry (which I was half expecting) and the bread was a lightly toasted/grilled focaccia.  The portion was about what I expected if not a little more generous.  As a side I ordered some of their beef chili.  It was maybe 3/5 stars and the only thing that kept me from leaving s five star review overall.  The beef seemed like it was cooked for too long and may not have been browned or drained before being added to the stock pot.  This leads to higher oil levels in the finished product, along with the beef sort of falling apart, and taking on sort of a grainy, chalky texture.  My experience is that  most people like small to medium sized chunks of ground beef when ordering chili. 

I would absolutely come here again, as I liked the overall experience, food quality, cleanliness of the establishment, pricing, and the fast turnaround to make my food after ordering.",0

If I come back, I will definitely go back to this place! Next time I want to try the chicken sandwich! Overall, SO satisfied!!",0
t6XxM5clvriK3PBSFBVH0g,_QDlxjPJf76c5O9OqY_tqA,3.0,2016-02-02 18:04:38,"Bustling new restaurant in downtown trenton.  Get there early, or you won't get a table.  Nice selection of sandwiches, but I think they can up their seasoning.  My friend got the grilled veggie sandwich, which had grilled veggies and fresh mozerella and olive oil.  It could have used some spices, or a balsamic vinegrette, or some pesto or something.  I had a grilled chicken sandwich.  Again, it would have been better if the chicken had been marinated in something with a nice flavor.  $10.00 for a sandwich and soda is a little pricier than other places in the neighborhood, but the quality of ingredients was high.  I'll probably go again, but will ask for something to jazz up the sandwiches.",0
AyLck2o-EOQ9Umxiz8bI_Q,_QDlxjPJf76c5O9OqY_tqA,4.0,2016-09-20 16:10:09,"The only thing holding me back from bestowing another star is the coffee. In the interest of full disclosure, I stopped in around 11 a.m., well past the breakfast rush. Lunch was on the way, and it smelled heavenly. But, I suspect I got an old cup of coffee, which was acrid, and set me back $2 (the same price I paid for the most perfect cup of coffee I had at Trenton Coffee House and Roaster last week). And the prep counter only offered one, unidentified type of creamer, which had a bluish cast. I suspect skim or some vile, non-dairy, grain/nut/legume milk*. I'm not sure why I didn't ask the staff for other creamer options. I could have. But I didn't want to trouble them -- which sounds like b.s. now that I'm complaining about it all. I may need to investigate my passive-aggression. I'm sorry. But, on the other hand, I think an establishment that prominently offers coffee should make sure the prep area has some real-world options, unless they are marketing specifically to the vegans. But don't think they are: I'm pretty sure I saw meat on the menu.

Anyway, now that's out of the way: I will definitely be back because I also ordered a coconut muffin, which was delicious. And the atmosphere is so cool! It's located a few steps below the sidewalk level, in a great location across the street from the State House and Thomas Edison State University. They have a really cozy, inviting, street side seating area, with the best tables: they're topped with area maps showing off all the cool things to find in Trenton, making them wonderful neighbors to other area business. People have been talking for years about the renaissance in Trenton, and places like this -- ""be the change you want to see"" make Trenton's super location and potential very clear. I'm very happy to have Cafe 128 in Trenton, and will be back soon for something other than coffee (though I suspect it's just fine most of the time!).

Hit it at a great time, in between lunch crowds.  Staff was friendly and accommodating.  I had the seafood over green salad.  Plenty of food to satisfy.  My cohorts each had a combo of either half sandwich and salad or half sandwich and soup.  It was a beautiful day and we elected to sit outside.  The staff brought our food out to us.  Unfortunately, the bees wanted our lunch as well so we grabbed it food and went back inside.  We were all pleased with our lunch. Great cafe in downtown Trenton!",0

I saw a review of this place on Hidden Trenton and mentioned it to him, since he usually grabs a cup of coffee at Dunkin' Donuts in the afternoons. (side note: we both work in downtown Trenton)

He had a bit of trouble finding the place (he described the building as ""nondescript""), and then the weather was bad which deterred him from venturing back out, but I knew he found it when I received the following text message yesterday afternoon:

""Well I waited three days for it but that is some of the best coffee I've had. The biscotti was a little expensive but in its defense it's the best damn biscotti I've ever had.""

He said it was $4.75 for a large coffee ($2.50) and the biscotti ($2.25), which he described as being a good size. It sounds like a quality stop in Trenton, and I'm looking forward to giving them a try.",0

I ordered from there this week and was incredibly disappointed.  This was my second time placing an order over the phone.  The woman that took my order over the phone was very short with me and acted like I was bothering her.  When I got there to pick up my order the woman at the counter was also rude to me.  I assumed she was the same person that took my order over the phone.  When I pulled out my credit card to pay for my food she said, ""Since you're paying with a credit card you can leave a tip!""  I was shocked!  Since when did people leave tips for take-out orders?  I walked a couple blocks to pick up my food.  I actually ended up leaving a tip because I felt put on the spot.  But I left a tip with the intension of never returning.  A great way to lose a customer is to ask for a tip when one is not required or deserved.",3

They have a good lunch menu with a wide selection of sandwiches, soups, salads or a combination of the two.  I went with the seared tuna steak with wasabi mayo and it was done right.  Prices are a bit higher than others in the area but worth it.  The shop is on the smaller side and packed with state workers from 12-2 so consider calling ahead.",0
7Fl8pkBhwxH_UvkAC94kOA,_QDlxjPJf76c5O9OqY_tqA,5.0,2016-08-03 17:41:33,"Been meaning to try this place for lunch since I walk by it a few times a month on my way to meetings - so glad I finally did! I planned to get whatever kind of salad with protein they offered (didn't review the menu before arriving) but quickly changed my mind to today's sandwich special - blackened salmon with seaweed salad, lettuce and tomato on a warm ciabatta roll. Hands down the best lunch I've had in Trenton! Sandwich was huge and came with a pickle and a bag of chips - well worth the $8 cost. Their regular offerings sound just as good, so I have plenty of other things to try. The decor was lovely - exposed brick, scenes of old-time Trenton, very cozy. Everything is made to order so I would imagine the wait for food could get long depending on how crowded it is, but today it was perfectly acceptable. I will definitely be back for more!",0

GWiHDNAcUXDu31Kn1f7b_g,_QDlxjPJf76c5O9OqY_tqA,5.0,2016-08-17 15:21:57,Tuna steak sandwich for $9 can't beat it (I feel like that's how much it costs to buy fresh tuna and cook it yourself). Everyone is really friendly and they have a great selection of loose leaf teas.,0
JKbQQdTFGw0almbdRSBvtQ,_QDlxjPJf76c5O9OqY_tqA,4.0,2016-02-19 02:44:02,"The cafe has a cozy feel with only five tables for two and three stools. Breakfast items are available the whole 7 am - 4 pm Monday - Friday they are open. I had a breakfast sandwich. The two eggs and cheese on flatbread were generous and filling. 

My spouse thought he was ordering sushi-grade tuna on a croissant but he actually got the seared tuna steak with wasabi mayo, lettuce and tomato. The sandwich was well presented but the crust was peppery and only the interior of the tuna was moist. When the ordering mixup was realized, we got to sample the sushi-grade tuna salad. Delicious!  We know what to order next time. 

Besides sandwiches, there are other breakfast items, flatbread pizza of the day, two salad and two soup options. There are a variety of hot and cold drinks to choose from.  The house blend coffee was flavorful. 

The menu says ""we're about preparing and serving great food"" and we believe they have delivered!",0
TeCDILEO1nQntt8YvpttxA,_QDlxjPJf76c5O9OqY_tqA,4.0,2016-01-14 16:05:32,"I was lucky enough to stumble into the Grand Opening of Café 128 one morning earlier this week.  The new coffee house is located at the prime location directly across from the State House on West State Street, and situated in a walk down basement space that has been very nicely renovated into a subterranean cozy space. Plenty of exposed brick, wood and granite all around.  
It was obvious they were still getting set up when I walked down the steps, but I was greeted warmly and welcomed to their new enterprise.  They do breakfast and lunch and appear to have state of the art equipment, including point of service payment system that allows the customer to use the latest technology to cover expenses without the staff touching a credit card.  
My order was a simple Everything Bagel with Butter and Swiss.  While I did not ask for it toasted, it came out that way.  No problem, as it appeared to have been pressed by a Panini iron that flattened the bagel, but also slightly melted the cheese and butter, but not enough to create a leakage issue.  It tasted very good as I drove back to the office.  The coffee was from the Small World Coffee people, and was a satisfying brew. The bagel was a good bite.  
 
If this house can manage the flow of lunch customers in that small space, they have a great opportunity to do very well there.  This stretch of West State Street in Trenton is very attractive these days, inviting people to walk and take their pleasures as they stroll.  

The proprietors are accomplished in the food trade, with other shops in Pennington and the sushi bar at Trenton Social.  They know ""...Renton."" 

Best of luck!",9

I've actually never seen a small coffee that size before. The soup was a lemon chicken orzo, which was good, but a little overcooked as the orzo was mush. Coffee was a little sour, like it had been made hours ago. So definitely not a great value--the soup was $4 and the coffee was $2.",1
CM7AJrtLHSMuvOTpr6FYhA,_QDlxjPJf76c5O9OqY_tqA,4.0,2017-11-23 19:35:47,"Tried Cafe 128 for the first time after hearing good reviews from friends and colleagues. It's a nice casual restaurant serving the standard lunch items such as sandwiches, soups, salads, flatbread pizza, etc. Somewhat reminds me of a slightly upscale Panera Bread with limited, yet creative menu items that seem to change on a daily basis which is nice. 

It's located in a lower basement level and is a tight, and seems to get crowded fairly quickly. We went around noon on a Tuesday and were able to find an open table for two. As mentioned, there's limited but creative menu items, unfortunately there didn't seem to be too many non-salad vegetarian items. I opted for the Flatbread Pizza of the day, which was eggplant (~$11.50). It took a fairly long time to make my order, must have been at least 15 minutes but it was delicious--well seasoned, crispy, and had a good balance of sauce and eggplant topping, which was a surprisingly good compliment to the pizza. 

Cafe 128 seems like a good place to get something to bring back to the office, but due to the crowds and small space might not be the best place to meet. It seems like a common go to for many within government, politics, lobbying and government relations professionals given the close proximity. I'd certainly go back to Cafe 128 when I have a bit more time, but overall food is a bit overpriced but delicious!",3
SFgt8dTPjN6dfWJDGYROEA,_QDlxjPJf76c5O9OqY_tqA,3.0,2019-08-22 17:50:58,Liked it a lot when it first opened but the quality of the food has diminished. Used to really like both the tuna and chicken salads but got the tuna and it tasted fishy and the ckn salad was so runny with whatever thin dressing was mixed with it. I think they must have cut back on costs at some point. Plus they play music so loud its hard to have a conversation. Shame as there aren't many places to go near there.  But the chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies are great.,0

As for the value, not so good.  In my opinion, for a $9.00 sandwhich, throw in a few chips on the side or a pickle. Too expensive to not throw in a side.

Also, ordered a chili which was very good. Flavorful an just slightly spicy, which will appeal to more people.

I'll probably go back, but only for chili. Hard to justify the cost for a lonely sandwhich.",1

Joe greeted me enthusiastically when I came in and he noticed I was shaking from the cold.  He made me a tea within 30 seconds to warm up. 

The menu was varied and the prices were very reasonable. The ambience of the café is nice, but my favorite part was Joe and his kindness. I highly recommend Cafe 128 to locals and visitors alike! If I make it back to Trenton, Café 128 will be my first stop.",1

There aren't many eateries within walking distance of all the offices in Downtown Trenton, so if you work in the area, the chances of seeing other people you know are pretty high. The cashiers are friendly, but the dining experience is kept to a fast-pace order system. 

I ordered the chicken sandwich, and despite the hefty price, it was a decently sizable and tasty lunch. I also got a pickle + bacon with my sandwich, which was a pleasant surprise. I look forward to visiting again and trying some of their famous soups!",1

Shared the cauliflower to start, which was interesting but not outstanding. I had the Strascinatti which was well-portioned and a tad on the salty side, and my date had the Roasted Chicken which was delicious and happily shared.

Overall, a nice fare in a tight and a bit purposefully austere setting that was in the end still delicious and warm. Service was excellent. And overall it was an enjoyable experience.",1

I was so intrigued by the coffee shop turned byob (Wednesday through Sunday at least) and went for dinner with a good bottle of wine. The concept works and the space is simple but beautiful. The service was spot on and the few dishes we tried were all delicious - my favorites were the root vegetable caponata and the mushroom pasta.

From the moment we walked in, our experience was incredible. Service was fast and we loved the BYO option, as well as the intimate setting. But, the real highlight was the food!

Add to that the deafening noise level and I could find no pleasure in our Wednesday dinner.  The food was good but not memorable.  The octopus appetizer was very good.

- CON: Went for breakfast -- sandwich had a precooked (not freshly cooked) egg, potatoes were oily, and even the music was a bit annoying (think obscure 90s rock that was a bad version of Pavement)

- BOTTOM LINE:  Went after this place was highly rated from Philly Mag.  Was thoroughly disappointed.  If you're looking for a superior breakfast sandwich & coffee in a welcoming all-day cafe -- skip this place & go to Hungry Pigeon instead.",3

It's a small cafe which gives it a neighborhood feel but also makes it not the best spot for getting work done. The coffee is from ReAnimator and is excellent (you get one free refill on drip which is nice but the cups are also super small). 

The breakfast sandwich isn't cheap after you add potatoes, a topping, and coffee to your order but the sandwich is quite good and surprisingly filling. I wasn't crazy about the sausage, maybe I'm just finally realizing I don't enjoy the taste of fennel.

And even better, it gets the coveted #MerlinFiiiiiive based on one dish alone: the breakfast sausage/egg sandwhich with cheese and ""herbal topping."" I'm still trying to figure out what's in that topping, but I've been thinking about it for days now, and it's unbelievable. They could serve cardboard for all their other dishes, and it wouldn't alter my rating at all. That's how good this sandwich is.",0

We got there at 730a.m. and it wasn't busy at all. Seating is limited but at that time of the morning there were plenty of places to sit.

I ordered the Egg and cheese on English muffin and added sausage. I also got a side of potatoes. Both the sandwich and the potatoes included a slathering of the herbed long hot spread. My breakfast came with free coffee and a refill.

I read reviews of this place and thought: Really, how good could a simple breakfast sandwich be? Well, everything was amazing. The smell of the coffee woke me right up and tasted fantastic. The English muffin was perfectly toasted and the egg and sausage were just delicious. The sauce was also a great touch. The potatoes were crispy and the sauce complimented them very well.

I'd eat here again in a heartbeat. (and again...and again).",2

By far, with all my food experiences I've had thus far - this sandwich is something totally memorable with the combinations of flavors in one perfect bite. First you have to give them props from the start with the homemade English Muffin, followed by the fluffy frittata, topped with oozy melted Asiago cheese, fennel sausage (added to the sandwich) and finally a spinach herbal sauce that has a wide range of spices. Any day of the week I would be ready to go back to have another bite of this sandwich. Will say, it will be hard to pick for next time to stop by the cafe to have another bite of the sandwich or wait a little longer in the day to try one of their pastas. Either way I know I'll be back in no time. 

Cafe itself is a quite small with roughly 12iish tables or so. As more people continue to find out about Res Ispa, I can see the lines for this cafe out the door or them needing to relocate.",0

I don't know how they cooked their egg but it was nicely formed without tasting/looking like those fake ""egg patties"" you sometimes see at eateries. The basil was delectable and you could tell was made fresh. The best part was probably the English muffin though. Once again, it was clear that they made them in house. They were very light and buttery. They very much reminded me of the biscuits I had in New Orleans (which were some of the best I've ever had.) I now know what a good English muffin tastes like!

I wasn't a huge fan of their coffee, it was quite bitter and they didn't have tops when I wanted to take whatever was left in a to go cup.

The small BYO restaurant is located on Walnut St and consists of only around 10 tables. The interior is minimalist with a clean  My friend mentioned that it would be impossible to eat there without a reservation, so make sure you book one!

We had dinner on a Friday night around 5:30pm and by 6pm, the place was completely full. For appetizer, we ordered the eggplant caponata to share. The smokiness of the eggplant came through and the grilled bread provided an nice vehicle to hold the vegetable relish and eggplant all in one bite. For the mains, we both shared 2 full size plates of the Spaghetti a la Vongole and the Strascinatti. Both pastas were cooked and seasoned perfectly. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate mousse, a great sweet note to end off the meal. Service during dinner was attentive, friendly and staff were always present if we needed anything.

I also tried Res Ipsa's breakfast sandwich a few days later during my visit in Philly. My friend and I arrived around 10:30am on a Monday morning and the place was only half full. After ordering our breakfast sandwiches and beverages from the counter, found a table to sit at. My Americano was great and the breakfast sandwich was delicious. All the components worked well together. I would definitely come back for more if I were visiting Philly.

Overall, great food, service and atmosphere! Would highly recommend!",4

X9Tv4Ng2BdMrySFT-llXsQ,_qgqa4X1OiMLqub1hHaMjg,5.0,2018-05-30 22:14:29,"This review is for dinner:

My boyfriend and I wanted to find a nice place to celebrate my last day in Philadelphia before moving. We were hoping for something special and intimate, and we stumbled on Res Ipsa through a friend's recommendation. After reading a few of the stellar reviews on Yelp, we decided to give it a try.

Now, I'm generally not one to choose Italian for a dinner out, because usually I feel that I can make most of the dishes at home myself. BUT LET ME TELL YOU - this place is 100% worth the price, and frankly, the price isn't even that steep. We chose an early time slot (~5:30pm) because we were warned that the place filled up later. The venue is small, but absolutely fits the vibe. You can watch the chefs - two, tatted up guys chatting and cooking up a storm - from almost any seat. The waitresses and hostess were perfect, not overbearing, and had suggestions whenever we asked for pointers. 

AND THE FOOD. Good lord. We started with the fried calamari, which was ultra delicate and crisp, and came with fried lemon slices (which we ate), and a few dollops of squid-ink aioli. We also tried their broccolini and tuna appetizer, which looked like it had just been picked from a garden, tiny yellow flowers and all. It was just the right amount of bitter, accented with tart caper berries. Amazing. 

We split a pasta dish (which you can get in half or full sized portions), and they gave us a second half portion on the house (!!). The first dish was a fazzoletti pasta, light, lemony, and dusted with dried fish roe. Our favorite of the two, though, was the second: gnocchi in a slightly spicy tomato-based sauce with fried eggplant. The pastas are handmade here, and you can tell - both offerings were cooked perfectly al dente. 

Finally, the main entree was a whole, beautiful, fresh fish. I'm ashamed to say I can't remember the exact type of fish, only that it was a white fish similar to bass. It was served with the head and fins, alongside grilled lemon and orange slices. Accompanying the fish was a ""side"" dish (in quotations because it was so unbelievably generous in size) of PERFECTLY crisped potatoes, broccoli rabe, and fennel root. Despite the fact that we were full to bursting, we practically licked the plates clean. 

This was one of the most memorable dinners I have had over my 4 years in Philadelphia, and that includes meals at Zahav, Buddakan, Morimoto, and Talula's Garden. I will most certainly be back when I visit again!",1

It definitely has a rich and creamy taste (if you add some milk to it). Definitely would recommend to try it.

Omg so good. Get it. 

I got the egg breakfast sandwich with fennel sausage and potatoes on the side. I normally am more of bacon egg and cheese than sausage+e+c but their sausage was so good! And there's some herby spinach mixture inside that took the sandwich to next level above other breakfast sandwiches. 

Also! Best. Home. Fries. Ever. It's tossed in with that herby mixture and the skins are crispy and browned to perfect deeper golden brown. 
But everything inside other than egg and cheese is additional $2-3 so it adds up quickly :/ 

Anyways another one of those good millennial brunch spots!",1

I had the eggplant sandwich but I found the bread a little too tough for my taste. Everything else was well done, from the eggplant to the sauce, and especially to the potatoes. Honestly I think the potatoes were the best part, they were incredibly soft and flavorful. I also had the iced coffee which was great as well. And on top of that - don't judge me - I also had an earl grey donut which was pretty standard, but an interesting flavor.

I ordered it with spinach and bacon and a side of potatoes. It took a little while to cook. I didn't count, but it felt a little too long for something that's not complicated.

The sandwich is a normal breakfast sandwich size. The muffin made in house was great and soft! However, the ""frittata"" was kind of dry and had a weird texture. I know they don't use microwaveable eggs like Starbucks and whatnot uses in their sandwiches, but it tasted that way. There wasn't a lot of bacon, and they put the herb long hot spread on top of the other ingredients in the sandwich instead of the bottom. I thought it was an unspoken rule that spreads go on the bottom. 

The potatoes were odd. They're whole petite-toes, instead of cut up, so they don't get crispy. They weren't bad. The salsa verde was bomb.

Everything was good, but it unfortunately didn't live up to the hype. I'd come back for the muffin, but would just get jam on it and a coffee.",0

The restaurant is located on Walnut Street in a small space with only 10 tables, so be sure to get a reservation. The space is well decorated, and the interiors are full of natural light during the day. It's a wonderful place for a date or conversation, but the tables are a close fit in case confidentiality is important. 

The service was outstanding -- I almost thought that they had found my Yelp Elite profile because it was so generous and wonderful. They brought a chef's tasting to my table of the eggplant caponata. I really despise eggplant, especially the texture. This dish was so delicious that it never occurred to me that it was eggplant, and I certainly did not hate it. I loved it. The smoked eggplant flavor was perfect, and the dish itself was a work of art.

I loved that the restaurant offers 1/2 orders of pasta, so I ended my meal with the Spaghetti a La Vongole. It was the perfect size for me, and I loved every bite. I ended the night with some of their own roasted coffee.

Being a lawyer, I love the name of the restaurant. ""The thing itself"" is wonderful and apparent on the surface, but also as you experience the depth of the creativity and hospitality here.",3

The menu is not extensive and things tend to be pricey and on the smaller side, but the quality is all right. (Mainly talking about the pastries because I can't say I'm super impressed with the reheated spongy egg square nestled between two crumbly, burned, fast-food-quality slices of English muffin that they pass off as a breakfast sandwich.) 

Other breakfast-y items include yogurt parfaits, and it seems like they also have salads and lunch sandwiches. It's not too crowded yet, so a good place to read while sipping coffee with a pastry or breakfast sandwich. The marble-topped tables are pretty.",10

Wanted to like it b/c I love the all-day dining concept, and have given it a few tries, but it really does seem like the emperor's new clothes to me. Waited at the counter while the skinny tattooed barista/server lady chatted with another employee for a few minutes. Finally turned to us, no warm welcome, and when we asked about stowing our baby stroller somewhere (it was collapsed and didn't take up much space) all she said was ""you can try... there's not much room in here."" Uh, thanks? We awkwardly tried to move a table ourselves (there were only two other tables occupied so we weren't disrupting anyone) until finally a kitchen worker who didn't speak English graciously came out and showed us we could tuck the stroller in behind the door. Maybe she should be the hostess/server instead since she was the most hospitable of the bunch! Waited 20 mins for very mediocre sandwiches. Asked for ketchup and server went to a neighboring table and took theirs to give to us. The whole experience was annoying and underwhelming.",0

Also, the place is tiny - we were a group of 4 and I think managing anything larger than 6 would be difficult. 

Res Ipsa for dinner is intimate but relaxed. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive. We got the tasting menu so we basically tried everything they had to offer. It was a ton of food and we all left full and happy! Standouts were the cauliflower and corn starters, and the spaghetti a la vongole, but the star was the roasted chicken! The sauce was so effing gooood and the meat was juicy and tender. When our waitress came to take our plates we all raved about it, and she said their recipe is online! Sure enough, a quick google search found it! I haven't tried to make it myself yet although why would I when I can make my way over to Res Ipsa and eat it with their amazing bread.. yum. 

Essentially, come hungry and be sure to order the chicken.",3

Got delivery for lunch

What I got:
Open Face Whitefish Sandwich (6/10)
This sandwich was fine.  I simply don't have much to say about it.  It is exactly as advertised and not much more.  It was quite filling though - much more than I expected!

Side of Potatoes (7/10)
These were great!  The flavor really came through and the potatoes seemed to be cooked very well, although they had gotten a little soggy by the time I actually had the opportunity to eat them due to delivery.  If they were still crispy, they would have been fantastic.

Caesar Salad (3/10)
I think there may have been a mistake here - one of my colleagues had also ordered the Caesar and our salads were miles apart.  First of all, my salad was lacking croutons and was nearly devoid of dressing.  It was also incredibly bitter for some reason and made it almost painful to eat.  I'm not sure if the bitterness was by intention or not, but the dearth of dressing definitely highlighted how much I noticed it.  I'm sure this salad isn't normally this bad, since most everything else was of high quality, and perhaps someone just made a mistake while preparing it.  Nevertheless, I cannot judge that hypothetical.  This was a dish I could not finish.

Final Word:
I've heard great things about Res Ipsa, but mostly pertaining to their dinner.  I will definitely look to come here again in the evening, but I am unlikely to be ordering from their lunch menu again - mostly due to the disappointing salad.",0

It's a very minimalist setup - even down to what's posted from the menu.  Simple and clean.  I like that.  

The breakfast sandwich had ""frittata, asiago fresco, and herb long hot spread"" and was on a house-made English muffin.  There was something a little funny about the texture of the spread, but it was overall a very unique sandwich and I enjoyed it.  I also ordered a side of potatoes, which come with salsa verde and chili oil.  The salsa verde was quite bitter and strangely crunchy, but the potatoes were cooked well and I'm not full without being in pain.

Lastly, they gave me a free coffee because I ordered a breakfast sandwich.  That is a great deal.  All three items for around $8.00.  It looks like it would be a very overpriced place because it's so chic, but I found this very fair.

I'd go again and try some of their incredible-looking savory pastries!",6

We were a party of six and any parties of five or larger are required to do the tasting menu.  They were very upfront about this and it was a great fit for our party.  We got to try so many things.  Things came out when they were ready and the waitress was wonderful about letting us know what each dish was and  how everything was divided.  There was bread with olive oil, first course (salads), pasta course, main course, and dessert course.  At the end of the first course we were already getting so full!  The pace was very fast, faster than you would expect for this type of dinner service.  The standouts in my mind were from the pasta course, some pasta with mushrooms, was incredible, and the chicken dish from the main course.  We had a vegetarian with us and they were very accommodating and always made sure to be very clear about what dish was veg friendly.  The place was small with a great ambiance.  It is BYO and they have a pretty strict reservation policy (big pet peeve of mine) but that did not detract from the overall experience.",0

And the side of potatoes that came with it was heavenly. Perfectly seasoned with oil and herbs, slightly crispy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside.

7siN9OeSY_ouMfJoVfR2aA,_qgqa4X1OiMLqub1hHaMjg,1.0,2017-06-08 12:26:37,"Our very unpleasant experience literally began at the front door.  Our party of four and another party of two arrived for our 5:30 reservations at 5:25.  The staff would not open the door until  precisely 5:30.  They looked at us through the glass; we looked at them.  Apparently no one ever pointed out to them the difference between rules of reason and rules of administration.  We found it annoying but that was only the beginning of a bad night.  

We entered to the loud sound of pulsing, beating music and took our seats, some of which with their curved backs were uncomfortable and made hanging our jackets on them virtually impossible.  We asked our wait person to lower the music, which she did, marginally.  The worst part was the loud percussion and bass, both driving a steady beat.  Hardly the sort of sounds conducive to sitting down with friends for a pleasant meal.  By now we have learned the music is primarily for the benefit of the staff but this was the most offensive choice of music any of us had encountered in a long time.  We asked them to again turn the volume lower, which they did, but the beat went on and on and on.  It was completely intrusive.

As for the meal, it was very mediocre at best.  An eggplant caponata had hardly any eggplant in it.  Contemporary chefs can be expected to experiment with traditional dishes, but this was ridiculous.  Two of us ordered the caponata and both of us thought it was anything but!  One of us ordered a roasted cauliflower, which was very generous but tasteless and unimaginative.  The fourth member of our party ordered two half-portions of pasta, which arrived literally sitting in precisely half the bowl as if the pasta was spooned out initially and cut precisely in half.  It was quite odd to see but reflecting an attitude of rigidity that conformed to the rest of the evening.  BTW, after our appetizers, the wait person asked if we wanted clean silverware for our entres.  Don't ask.  Just change it.

The pastas were terrible.  Two of us ordered spaghetti al vongole.  It arrived with cheese already spread on it (an absolute no-no to say nothing of being the diner's choice, not the chef's) and was too salty.  Our friend who ordered the two half portions of pasta received one dish (the name of which escapes me) of a wide, ribbon pasta.  All of us sampled it and decided it was without question completely tasteless....as in no taste other than the pasta.  We are all reasonably sophisticated eaters (and one among us spends a month in Italy every year for more than 30 years.)  None of us could identify a single flavor other than the pasta in the dish in question.

We ordered two desserts against most of our better judgments and shared them..  The mouse was very good. 

So, we collectively ordered three appetizers, three entre-sized pastas, two half-portion pastas, and two desserts.  With tax and tip the bill was $189.  NEVER again.

BTW:  The single $ and average price of $10 listed for this restaurant would not even cover a single appetizer at dinner.  Clearly that figure is based on breakfast and not a very substantial one at that!",0

My problem was with the arrogance of the ""Chef"", who refused to let us box our left overs.  I'm sorry, but I if I can't finish what was served and what I paid for, I expect the opportunity to have it boxed so I could enjoy it later.  When I asked to have my left over boxed, I was told that the ""Chef"" wouldn't allow it. Excuse me Mr. Chef, but I've eaten at plenty of superior restaurants in Philadelphia and never had this problem.  As a result, I probably won't return since there are so many better options that are more accommodating in the city.  Seems like the Philly Mag ranking may have gone to your head.

My boyfriend and I visited for our 1 year anniversary and followed our wonderful waitress' (Mary) recommendation to do the Chef's tasting. You get to try several of their incredible dishes and it's 100% worth it in order to sample a lot of the menu and it comes out to a similar price point if you would want to split a few items with your party. Service was fantastic and the Chef even personally came out to greet us and say happy anniversary while also offering us to choose whichever dessert dish we chose. The atmosphere is simplistic by nature, which I think adds to the allure of this hidden gem!

Pasta is among the best I've had in Philadelphia.  The service is excellent - the wait staff knows every dish and is very attentive.

But let's not kid ourselves - this is not Vernick, it's not Vetri (or even Osteria).  The menu is so limited that every single dish has to rock my world to get into that category - and it's just not quite there yet.  Also, the atmosphere for dinner is just too loud for my taste - it was hard to hear myself think.  And what's up with the upside-down appetizers?  Feels too much like a gimmick.

I'll definitely come here again, but I also hope this place evolves a bit more.  Though it isn't in the category of the restaurants I mentioned above, I'd like to see it strive to get there.

A couple of the sauces had similar/overlapping flavor-profiles. A lot of things just ended up tasting strongly of parsley. The tasting portions of the pastas had a lot of variance with the portion sizes, but for the most part were overpriced for the amount of food considering that the flavors were pretty underwhelming. The music was really unnecessarily loud. Best part of the meal was probably the bread and dipping oil, which was nice with fresh oregano and crushed red pepper.",0

It's BYO, which is great, and there is no corkage fee, which is greater!

We started off with the grilled octopus and the root veggies. Both were delicious, although the octopus was a bit too charred. We were guessing which veggies were which, as the textures and flavors were different on each bite. It was fun for the taste buds.

Then we shared the gnocchi, funghi, and vongole pastas. Each dish was so flavorful and perfectly cooked. The gnocchi had a kick of spice at the end. The funghi pasta was balanced and not too heavy. And the vongole had the right amount of garlic to balance the clams. My only complaint is that the portions for the pasta were quite small, even for the full-size portions.

So, for my last meal after a long weekend in Philly, I gave it a shot...

EGG & CHEESE: Sandwich with  fennel-cardamom sausage, frittata, asiago fresco, herb long hot spread, house English muffin ($6.50; that includes $2 extra for the sausage; other additions also available)

I have to say this was a really nice start to the day.  Although quite a bit more expensive than an Egg McMuffin, this is what you wish Micky D's was putting out.  Not many places make their own English muffins and this was excellent, although I wish it were more toasted to give the sandwich some texture.  Also, the house-made sausage and the frittata had a tendency to slide in different directions, so maybe a some changes to sandwich architecture are warranted.

Res Ipsa is a tiny, modern, minimalist space with very limited seating in front and a small kitchen behind.  I look forward to trying their dinner menu the next time I'm in Philly.  The photos on social media look amazing.

Absolute perfection; I will literally be dreaming of this sandwich. 
The English muffin breakfast sandwich with pancetta was excellent as well (delicious pesto sauce on this), as were the variety of pastries we sampled. Staff was very friendly and helpful. And even though we had a large party, we didn't feel crowded or rushed in the cozy space.

The restaurant is very nice, if a bit on the loud side. The Wait staff was excellent. For starters we had the ""Tomatoes"" and the ""Potatoes"".

Both the breakfast sandwich and the Italian Breakfast were heavy on the salt, the biscuits were average, and some parts of the meal were downright inedible. My favorite part of the meal was the potatoes that came with the sandwich, which we could also just make at home.  The food also seems overpriced given the portions are on the smaller side.  Overall, the cafe has a nice ambiance and an interesting approach to breakfast, but unfortunately I'm not a fan.",6

The cauliflower was definitely one of the best I've ever had at a restaurant. The gnocchi and strascinatti were both delicious. We were not huge fans of the fazzoletti - the spicy and sweet flavoring of the sauce just didn't do it for us. 

Second, the price. We ordered 1 appetizer and 3 half pastas and spent $50 for the entire meal. It's BYOB which really helps with the cost. 

Third, it is a casual cafe during the day that turns into a delicious Italian restaurant at night. I have to imagine that this concept is a bit hard to pull off but Res Ipsa seamlessly transitions from casual to classy. I look forward to eating breakfast here sometime and highly recommend for dinner!",2

It's small inside which doesn't seem to be a problem at 8:00am, but I'm guessing it fills up quickly around lunch or dinner.  

I ordered my coffee, debated on the sandwich for a couple of seconds, and then decided to have it ""here"" and absorb some of the atmosphere.  The young woman who took my order was quite friendly and gave good service.

I sat with my coffee and waited for my sandwich.  Even from the first sip, coffee was very good, not your commonplace coffee-chain crap (i.e., Starbucks).  After a few minutes, my breakfast sandwich was brought over to me.  

The sandwich was made by stacking a thick frittata, cheese, sausage, and fennel in between a muffin.  The sandwich was good with a spicy kick, however the egg was unevenly heated:  hot on the edges and not hot in the middle.  

Borderline 3 stars (I'd do 2.5 or 2.75 if I could, but I can't, and 2 seems a bit low despite the unevenly heated egg.)  I wouldn't mind coming back here and give it another shot before passing full judgement.",3

I had their known breakfast sandwich.  It was ok.   The house made English muffin was the best part 

I also had a chipotle chicken sandwich.  A solid B- sandwich.   The potatoes were really good!  

I  would definitely like to check out dinner some time!

We chose the chef tasting menu after the waitress heavily suggested it was the best option. Halfway through our main entree, another waitress told us our table was needed for another reservation so we needed to finish quickly or box up our meal.

This stop was during my unofficial ""Philly Breakfast Sandwich Mini Tour"" and so I was mainly in hot pursuit of Res Ipsa's lauded breakfast sandwich anyway. The tour was mini because I only went to like a handful of different places before getting back to açaí bowls, but I digress. 

So anyway, about that breakfast sandwich. The egg frittata was spongy but I enjoyed the spring. The salsa verde made the whole shebang pop and added some zest with just enough heat to make your lips tingle. Got another kick of spice from the sausage patty, too. The sautéed spinach toned it down a bit, while the asiago lent a cheesy breezy sharpness. A lot going on in this little vehicle, but it was a well-composed sandwich, and the elements complemented each other. More green than your average meat, egg, and cheese, but it was a welcome change. The homemade English muffin kinda took it to the next level for me.

I could've easily downed two of these bad babies. Since I liked what I had lots, I'll probably be back soon to commit an act of bad breakfast behavior. That'll undoubtedly include two breakfast sandwiches, a latte, and those supposedly stellar crispy potatoes even though white potatoes normally put me tf to sleep. Zzzzz",1

I ordered the fried green tomato sandwich, which was served with pickled onion, tomato jam, greens, and a side of potatoes. Everything was seasoned to perfection. My only gripe was that the buns were almost uncomfortably thick. I ended up eating the sandwich open-faced, which was obviously still delicious. I shared the roasted potatoes with my dining partner and we both enjoyed the kick provided by the salsa verde sauce. To be honest, these were probably the best roasted potatoes I've tried to date.

If you're like me, you'll enjoy Res Ipsa's minimalist decor, location proximate to the Schuylkill River, and unique food options.

Not only did our waiter Noah welcome us with excellent service, but he also gave us a list of great food and drink spots around the city.  What a welcoming start to our week in Philadelphia.  The chef, Michael, also told us many other restaurants whom were familiar with him that we could go to.  All-in-all, this food was amazing.  We started with the grilled broccoli, and we embarrassingly scarfed it down while waiting for our entrees.  I got a spaghetti dish with clams and my girlfriend decided on the orecchiette with mushrooms. Both dishes were fantastic, and we were brought another smaller dish to try (can't remember the name, but holy shit it was the best pasta I have ever eaten).  We got both desserts because we felt so much trust in the chef.  The chocolate mousse outshined it all with a crispy and delightful coconut top.  The blood orange cake was great as well, but I could not stop tasting the mousse.  I would have done the chefs tasting menu if I could do it again.  Not because I was unsatisfied, but because I know how wonderful it would have been!  I loved the small menu size that allows the chefs creativity to show, and the music variety was hip and fitting.  The music was a bit loud, but Noah, Mary, and Michael made the experience unforgettable.  We will be returning next time we come to Philly.",0

It's beautiful inside, and the servers were very nice but unfortunately that's where the good experience ended for me. We were warned that all the food would come out at once and that we couldn't add things later and we were fine with that. Our table of 4 ordered two mezze, two full pasta, one half pasta, and half a chicken. There was only one person eating the chicken, and the rest of us shared everything else. I wasn't in love with any of the flavors but I didn't hate anything. However, all the mezze had come out and all the pastas were finished and then we waited another 20 minutes before the chicken came out. A server poured tap water on top of the sparkling water in my glass. We ordered two desserts and a tea and the server forgot the tea and brought it to us in a to go cup. Then on the way home two of us had terrible stomach aches and spent much of the next half hour in the bathroom. I can't say for certain it was the food here, but I suspect it was.

sBdGEJz8Nb3pVfCkeDDhTg,_qgqa4X1OiMLqub1hHaMjg,5.0,2018-02-22 15:40:17,"Breakfast: it's a cute little cafe, brightly lit by the natural light that comes in through the huge windows. I found it a bit expensive, but the breakfast sandwiches are not some Yelp fad lie. They are perfectly flaky, rich, and delicious. I also got the Italian Breakfast, which was hearty and the perfect portion size. The coffee was great and it was a satisfying morning pick-me-up. A nice place to catch up with a friend, do some work, or some reading. 

However, it's the dinner service that makes me give this place a 5 star rating (I wish I could give it 6 stars, especially since it's BYOB). I would definitely recommend securing a reservation for dinner - it's such a small space and I would be surprised if there were available walk-ins. The service was spectacular - super friendly, down to earth, kind of quirky - but knew what they were talking about and really explained the food well. We chose the Chef's Tasting Menu, which I highly recommend. Words cannot describe how good the food was. Every dish was thought out and intricate, yet not overly complicated or confusing. The star of the dinner was the pasta course, with a majority of the pastas made in house. The gnocchi sardi with eggplant and chili was incredible, and I don't even like eggplant that much. Afterward, they brought out the bucatini which was made with uni (sea urchin) and breadcrumb (and i'm sure other things, but those were the biggest things I noticed). Amazing. The dish was both simple, but complex, light, but rich. I was so impressed. We also got spaghetti with clams, which was really nice and a good transition dish into the whole sea bass with citrus. The fish was also really well made and easy to eat, I would recommend it. 

For dessert, since it was my birthday, they brought out a panna cotta with this great toffee crumble with a little candle on the side. The staff was great and I am absolutely amazed at the restaurant. It's small, and the kitchen is visibly very small, but they must use the ingredients very efficiently. I can't imagine they have the space to afford to have a million different ingredients back there and have a million different things going on. No, you could see the chef's cooking and nothing was congested or felt rushed. They didn't seem to be stressed out at all, which made the dining experience a lot better on our end. Truly an enjoyable and unforgettable experience! You'll see me back there soon.",5

They offer a tasting menu for $65 per person or let you order a la carte. For us, as vegetarians, it is key for a restaurant to not just ""take off the meat"" from a recipe and call it a vegetarian dish - Res Ipsa certainly passes this test, since they had a couple of appetizers and two or three pasta dishes on the menu that were veggie-friendly. 

Atmosphere: The place's size is perfect for a coffee shop, but is a little tight for a nice sit down restaurant with wait staff walking around, and the door opening every few minutes, bringing in a wintry-chill. The lighting was a little too bright, which took away from the experience. The waitstaff were fantastic - professional and very friendly and helpful with making decisions. 

Cafe Food: Res Ipsa has a delicious egg sandwich that you can get with a side of potatoes and salsa verde. Coffee is great and baristas are very knowledgeable and friendly. 

Dinner Food: The dinner food was, unfortunately, for vegetarians, a little hit-or-miss. We ordered two appetizers: Roasted Cauliflower and Mushroom Caponata. These were tasty but didn't seem to have that complex, unique flavor that some other restaurants in the city provide. You could, however, tell that the quality of the ingredients was top notch. We ordered two pasta dishes as our entrees: the Gnocchi Sardi (arrabiata), and the Strascinatti (pasta with mushrooms, marjoram, and parmesan). The gnocchi - delicious (one of the best red sauces I have had in the city). The Strascinatti though - not so much. It just seemed like there was not much flavor in the Strascinatti, a doughy pasta with a plain oil-based sauce. Not sure if it was just that day, but the dish didn't seem ""put together"" or delicious.

Having explored quite a bit of the fine and casual dining scene of Philadelphia we arrived on a Friday night at Res Ipsa with some reviews promising an upcoming star restaurant dinner experience. We were not expecting our experience to be that close to perfection.

The dishes -all 6 that we ordered plus (and most importantly) the 2 complimentary (!) that the chef thought we would enjoy- were outstanding. All dishes were very rich with the ingredients being elevated and infused with extra flavors through processes like pickling or burning. Most impressive was that there was a big reuse of basic ingredients of the Italian cuisine across dishes (pine nuts, peppers, basil, mint, arugula) but they served very different roles in every plate, providing though a very consistent palette across the menu. I do not think I have eaten anything more elegant and simple at the same time than the special lamb tartare (with anchovy aioili, arugula, mint, fennel?, ... served on a crisped semolina bread). It reminded me of the simplicity of a good Greek gyro but on a perfectly balanced dish. The artichoke salad was also to die for. The pasta felt perfectly made and cooked and all little hints of flavors in dishes like the star anise'd fennel, the smokiness of burnt orange and acidity of lemon juice in the slow cooked rabbit pasta, and the saltiness in the dessert clinched the deal. On the negatives I might say that maybe we found one (yes just one) slightly undercooked potato and some undercooked peas and our, otherwise perfectly herbed, seasoned and filleted, fish was one tiny notch on the drier side than our Greek culture standards would prefer.

And to top this great dining experience, I don't think we have every encountered more welcoming staff in a restaurant. All 3 servers that assisted us were extremely polite and pleasant to talk to and made us feel very comfortable asking anything. Chef Michael did the extra mile and came on several, if not all, tables to talk with people and get feedback. The dining scene bar is pretty low, in a way that the excellent service we received at Res Ipsa made us feel spoiled and that we did not deserve any of this. Congratulations on the whole team for creating something extraordinary and making people feeling respected and welcomed.

Ambience is not my top priority, and having loved places like the closed now Marigold kitchen, I did not mind at all the multipurpose of the decoration that facilitates both the same place operating as a traditional coffee house in the day turning into a great restaurant at night. Actually, it's probably what gives this place some character.

The light came from a new homegrown café named ""Res Ipsa""! How witty *and* erudite! (yeah, you and me, look it up)

Staff were all friendly & briefly conversational (i.e. not intrusive). Ordering for us was at the counter; servers promptly brought the order to our table. See my snapshot of its menu(s). 

Some baked goods and locally roasted coffee were winners: 1) a focaccia topped with roasted garlic, pancetta and spinach; 2) their house made English muffin to which I added sweet butter (i.e. no salt that I could detect, like American typical butter has). My companion liked the flavor & texture of his pastry and said he thought it good sized.

Their coffee is by local roasters ReAnimator, whose products I hadn't ever tasted before. I always ask for a black coffee, the café's dark roast (my preferred type!) My cup was the perfect temperature for sipping and somehow stayed tasty as it cooled. P.S. I liked their choice of china for the cups: simple lines, appropriately sized & shaped handle, and best of all a thin rim edge which makes drinking coffee perfectly easy & dribble-proof.",1

I had only modest expectations for an affordable offering at Res Ipsa, a charming, minimalist, yet welcoming and unpretentious spot in a historically mostly charmless stretch of Walnut St.

The breakfast sandwich, laden with a square-formed egg, sautéed spinach, and house-made fennel sausage, and on fresh, quality bread, was excellent-- a sloppy mess without being greasy, its individual ingredients carefully seasoned to perfection, and well-proportioned. The coffee was great.

I would love to go back and try the rest of the menu!",2
sRF8VHsb6as3mruI2PVRkg,_qgqa4X1OiMLqub1hHaMjg,4.0,2018-06-16 03:11:07,"Went to Res Ipsa on a Friday night after hearing some great reviews about their food. I ordered the tasting menu ($60), which they were gracious enough to do for just one person. Although, the food portions seemed much like a dinner for two. The whole meal was a bit of a rollercoaster for me, so let's get into it.


The meal started with some housemade semolina bread served with olive oil. The oil had red pepper flakes, some herbs, pepper, and salt. The bread had a great crackly exterior, but the inside was just a tad dry. Also, it seems like very few restaurants serve warm bread nowadays. Here was no exception.


First course was their eggplant caponata. Essentially a piece of bread topped with eggplant, golden raisins, pine nuts, onions, and greens among other things. The bread held up under all those toppings, but the whole dish was too oily for me. I liked the sweet juiciness of the raisins matched with the vinegary dressing the greens seemed to be coated in. Flavors were good, bread was good. My hands just ended up covered in oil by the end of this dish.


Then came their poached shrimp, served with green onions, fennel, olives, and other embellishments with a side of shrimp risotto crackers. The dish was gorgeous and colorful. The lightness of the shrimp was nicely balanced and not overpowered by the olives underneath. The crackers on their own tasted a bit like salty, knockoff shrimp crackers with an extra kick of brininess, but once paired with the shrimp to make a mock hors d'oeuvres, the flavors melded together nicely. My only complaint about the shrimp was its texture. It was definitely tender, though a little mushy. Personally, I prefer shrimp cooked to a crunchy, crispy texture, so eating this dish was a little off-putting.


Next up was their bucatini. A simple dish with ricotta, fresh cherry tomatoes, and breadcrumbs. I have never been a fan of tomatoes, I don't generally like eating whole tomatoes in any dish. However, this pasta dish made me appreciate those cherry tomatoes. The toasted breadcrumbs added another dimension of flavor, and the juicy tomatoes kept the dish from becoming overly rich. The only downside was the pasta's texture. The bucatini felt a bit brittle and didn't have quite the chew I was looking for.


A second pasta dish came, which was their trofie con pesto. Instead of a traditional pesto, they used almonds and pistachio with a hint of orange. This pasta had the perfect noodle chew that I wanted in the previous dish, and the chopped nuts added some crunch and sweetness.


At this point, it seemed like the dishes were on the up and up, and I highly anticipated my entree of fish. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. The entree was huge, a portion big enough for 2 people. The fish (some Mediterranean sea bass) came topped with salsa verde with some charred lemons and oranges on the side. There was an entirely separate plate of side vegetables consisting of potatoes, broccoli rabe, peppers, and some citrus salad. Unfortunately, none of this dish worked for me. The fish was dry, and I found an unusual amount of bones while eating. The salsa verde didn't feel like it belonged. The charred orange, though delicious by itself, also didn't taste that great paired with the fish, and I wasn't quite sure what to do with it. The vegetables also seemed random without something to tie them all together. The broccoli rabe had no companion to tone down its excessive bitterness, the citrus salad was just there, perhaps a vague link back to the citrus with the fish, and the potatoes added nothing to the entree. Honestly, it was all over the place.


Finally, dessert. I hoped for some redeeming quality to end this dinner. I think I got it. Dessert was a chocolate hazelnut mousse topped with a coconut florentine and some surprise citrusy hazelnut syrup and slivered almonds inside. The mousse was creamy and not too rich. I learned afterwards that the dish was actually made with coconut milk. My favorite part was the almonds inside. I wish the cookie on top could have been crisper so that I could break into it much like you break into a creme brulee. At this point, though, my stomach was nearly bursting, so I was happy with a dessert that wasn't too decadent.


Overall, dining at Res Ipsa was a good experience, but perhaps you should stick to the pastas.",0

No real flavor, few flakes of cheese between the square of frittata. Pretty small, and I'm usually stuffed at most restaurants. Got the potatoes which were overall pretty good, but a few were a bit undercooked. The good ones had a nice crisp ish exterior and soft interior. Honestly needed ketchup which is too bad...just a bit more seasoning could have gone a long way. The salsa verde (I guess) was on both the sandwich and the potatoes--bit spicy.

Counter service where they drop off your food but you clean up yourself. Small restaurant had more of a cafe vibe. Having trouble picturing it as a dinner spot but maybe it's more impressive for dinner?",0

My avocado toast left something to be desired (very small and skimpy on the avocado considering it cost me $6), but the homemade muffin with frittata and asiago and sausage was really delicious.

My friend and I came in around 9:45 on a Saturday and it wasn't super busy. We sat at at table with coffee stains and crumbs from the previous patrons, neither of the servers where busing tables though, as I mentioned, it wasn't even busy.

We both ordered the Italian breakfast, which I had heard was their signature. Fast forward half an hr and we still have yet to get our food, which is unsettling as we had a train to catch. The server said it takes half an hr, something they did not mention upon ordering, and honestly I'm confused as to why. We asked to have it to go since we seriously had to leave, and he said they don't do it to go, ""chef's orders"". Finally it came, and they did give us plastic boxes to put in in, but I'm honestly confused why this didn't take 5 minutes. Pre-made beans, which were salty and still slightly crunchy, a sloppily fried egg, some braised, wet greens and a greasy sausage patty. 

We shoveled what we could down our throats and ran out to catch our train. This place has is supposed to be one of Philly's top in the food scene, however I think its really over rated and needs some management help.",1

This is a restaurant to go to if you are concerned about portion control and your weight.  You will eat out and not overeat, because the portions are so small.  

We ordered 3 half portions of pasta and 3 appetizers.  The half portions of pasta, while tasty, are what I would feed a small child who is only a little hungry. The appetizers were on the small size, although the cauliflower was what one would expect. 

I could have eaten all three half portions of pasta by myself.  

I am not asking for heaps of pasta, just a reasonable amount.  I know this is homemade and not dried stuff.  Nevertheless, you should double what is on the plate.

If you don't improve the pasta portions you should consider putting the disclaimer Caetera desunt under your pasta portion sizes.

There are so many great restaurants in Philly currently, but sometimes I feel as though I am eating the same type of food at every restaurant.  This is not inherently bad, but in the case of Res Ipsa I find myself going back more than any other restaurant because it feels more special.  While on paper this is simply Italian food with some of the best house-made pasta in the city, it's much more than that.  Michael Ferreri's unique approach to vegetables in all of the appetizers I have eaten are some of the best in the city.  I would also argue his octopus dish is always one of my favorites.  Some of the more unusual appetizers/specials I have eaten here (such as the house cured anchovies) are some of the best things I've eaten in Philly.  While there are plenty of other restaurants in the city that make their pasta in house, there is just something about having pasta at Res Ipsa.  It feels more like home cooking because it's made by the same two people to order every time.  It just makes the food and experience that much better.  There have been occasional dishes that I have not loved to be honest, but these few blips do not change my opinion of the food overall.",2

We heard about this restaurant from another local Philly chef and were lucky to snag a same-day dinner reservation this past Sunday. 

The ambiance of the restaurant is the perfect balance of minimalist modern meets fine dining. It felt casual and homey yet still like we were out for a ~nicer~ dinner. The servers were also super friendly and knowledgeable about every dish that came out. The restaurant seems to have a bunch of regulars as well, which is promising. 

We opted for a light dinner and only ordered a few dishes:

Eggplant Caponata (5/5) - MUST ORDER! The eggplant was perfectly balanced by the mix of herbs on top (basil, purple basil, mint, fennel, lemon balm) and comes with grilled house made bread.

Potatoes (3/5) - cooked really nicely (crispy charred but didn't taste burnt) and had a nice tangy sauce, we would probably pass on this one next time to try something more unique

Pasta con le sarde (5/5) - really light and the taste of the sardines really comes through without being too fishy. Pine nuts were a nice touch!!

Gnocchi (4/5) - according to our server voted best gnocchi in Philly! Theirs is unique in that they use semolina flour instead of potato, so the gnocchi itself has a nice bite to it instead of the typical more mushy texture. Turned my bf into a gnocchi fan again :D 

We did half portions for both pastas and it ended up being between 4-5ish bites of each between two of us. Good option if you're looking to try a variety of items. 

Hope to be back soon and try the tasting menu!

#1 we ordered an additional pasta after eating our main course (at 7:30 pm) because the portions were smaller than we expected. As we made this request, the waitress rudely said, ""I'm not sure if we can put in that order. I'll have to check with the chef."" This should not have mattered and was confusing to us, as we were an active table still dining in the middle of dinner service. 

#2 it's a BYO restaurant and we had a couple of bottles of wine. We had one more bottle to open over dessert, and we asked a waitress to open the last bottle. After agreeing to open the bottle, the waitress also offered to close out the tab, at which point she agreed to open the bottle and also took our credit card. The other waitress mentioned earlier came over as we awaited our final receipt as well as our wine opening, and she said she couldn't open the bottle because they already closed out. We understand this is policy, but it didn't make sense because we had asked the original waitress to open the wine before we closed out, and she had agreed.  We would not have closed out if we knew they would go back on their word, which they did as soon as they took our credit card. We explained this reasoning, thinking our original waitress would honor her word on opening our bottle. Wrong...she went back on her word and ruined what was otherwise a nice dinner, saying we had already closed out, and they could not open our bottle and had to immediately turn the table, while no one was waiting and there were multiple open tables of our party size.

Atmosphere: Not too loud, but a good level of background noise. It is a very small place however. We sat at the table closest by the kitchen and it was a little uncomfortable/distracting every time someone walked past.

Presentation was beautiful and both were different from anything we've had before. Octopus was good but potato confit was eh.

Ever since I had fried green tomatoes in Atlanta, I fell in love with the dish, so whenever I see them on a menu, I have to try them.  This sandwich was great!  The perfect ratio of a thick fried green tomato to bread to shaved shallots, arugula, and spicy remoulade made for a wonderful sandwich.  Lots of flavors coming together in perfect harmony.
The potatoes were also super yummy!  They had this chili oil drizzled over them with a salsa verde....you have to have have them!

My friend had the grilled cheese and tomato soup combination, and that was also delicious.  I tasted some, and the tomato soup was the perfect thickness and had tons of flavor.  the cheese combo in the grilled cheese was also delicious and there wasn't too much bread, it was a great balance of cheese to bread.  A perfect option for a chilly day!

The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because my friend really wanted to the fried green tomato sandwich but wanted the soup instead of potatoes, or to maybe get a side of soup with a different sandwich rather than the grilled cheese, she would have happily paid extra....when she asked if this was possible, the woman taking our order said she didn't know and didn't think she could substitute or order a side of soup.  She kind of made it feel like a huge inconvenience that we were even asking.  I feel like she could have asked the chef or someone else who worked there (since she said she wasn't sure) instead of making us feel a little crazy for asking. It was a little disappointing for my friend, and she didn't understand why she couldn't just pay a few extra bucks for a side of soup with another sandwich.  I understand if they don't allow changes to the menu, but they sell the potatoes as a side, so why not the soup?  I see both sides to this situation, my friends and the restaurants, I am mentioning it  because I think she could have said no in a better way if that was their policy. Also, just don't make your customers feel like they are an inconvenience for asking a question.  Otherwise the staff was fine, we were served in a timely manor, and they were friendly and ultimately, she enjoyed her grilled cheese.

On a brighter note, our experience at this adorable place (aside from the one thing mentioned above...which wasn't even that big of a deal, I just thought it was worth mentioning) was really good.  The food was fantastic, and the price was pretty cheap! I will absolutely be back, I cannot wait to try more of the food here!  I highly suggest trying Res Ipsa Cafe if you are nearby and hungry!",5
IkBffjjd0XqOUOP7TP5BEw,_qgqa4X1OiMLqub1hHaMjg,2.0,2020-03-03 14:28:56,"I was really excited to try Res Ipsa for dinner, but I don't think it lives up to the hype. It's a cozy Italian spot that doubles as a cafe in the mornings. Very intimate seating for around 20-25 people. 
 
Atmosphere: Intimate, though usually packed - definitely requires a reservation in advance. The setting is probably best for groups of 2-4, or anything 6 or less. The BYOB aspect is nice. The servers were also very friendly. Seating was a bit close - you could overhear other folks' conversations.

Food: The pasta portion sizes were underwhelming. Yes, they recommend ordering multiple ""small"" pasta dishes to share, but a ""small"" pasta dish had maybe 4-5 bites in total of food, for ~$15. I ended up paying ~$35 in total for a few bites of octopus, which we ordered as a starter, and 4 bites of pasta in total (we split 2 small pasta dishes). Yes the pasta tasted homemade, but I felt like I could've ordered very similar quality of food for a much cheaper price / much larger portion size. The octopus was paired very well with their sauces and celery, and included small potato balls as well.

Overall:  - I likely won't be back for their pasta, simply because it felt overpriced for the quality. I hear the chicken is the best thing to get here, so maybe I'll be back for that... I'll be eating my pasta elsewhere, though.",0

First - they messed up on seating. After having told them explicitly 3 times, one week in advance, they failed to account for our one year old. Fine.

- the server stopped by every 2 mins questioning if we wanted to place in an order. They were obviously in a hurry to turn tables. We  placed the order for apps, and within seconds the second waitress approached asking us to place an entree order. Feeling rushed, we order 3 things to which she responded ""the chef wont accept incomplete orders because it is such a busy night for us"".
After entree, we wanted to order more food. The chef came to our table to tell us that we weren't allowed to order more food because a. We were ""delayed"" in ordering food. (Apparently, there is a benchmarked food order time after the party is seated.) It was a busy night for them
C. They had to turn the table.

All in, it was the worst experience (I tavel around the country weekly). While I understand their need to turn tables, we weren't killing time. We were giving them more business, as a matter of fact. The owner/chef comes across pompous, and arrogant. His greed and ignorance far exceeds the zest to serve high quality food. 

I will not return to this establishment, and neither will my friends.",0

The first course we got was the octopus which was very tasty. Even my fiancé who doesn't like octopus enjoyed it. Then we got the gnocchi and the pesto pasta. Both were good but because the gnocchi was so flavorful the other pasta fell short. It could have benefited from some salt. The final dishes were the orecchiette special and the fazzoletti pasta. We really enjoyed both pastas but since the orecchiette dish was so flavorful, again the other dish fell short.  The only real criticism I have is that it's a small space so it can get extremely loud. Ultimately, service was impeccable, food was tasty and we will definitely be back to try more.",0

Since then, Philly Mag has designated it a spot in their Top 50 Restaurants of Philadelphia. On a snowy March day, a friend and I decided to head over for lunch to see what the hype was all about. The cafe was much smaller than we expected, maybe seating 20 at the most. All of the tables were full, so we decided to take out food to go, but a table opened up at the last minute. I ordered the breakfast sandwich with fennel sausage and spinach with a side of potatoes, and my friend ordered the eggplant lunch sandwich. As simple as my breakfast sandwich was, it was made exquisitely. The egg was baked, frittata style, and the sausage was rich. The cheese was perfectly melted, and spinach and pesto sauce all together created a flavor-packed bite. The potatoes were small potatoes that were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, seasoned with salsa verde. My friend really enjoyed her meal as well! The staff was very friendly and accommodating, and although small, the turnover in the cafe seemed pretty quick. After partaking in their sandwiches, I can't wait to see what their tasting menu is like!",2

I enjoyed the new take on this staple. The sandwich had just a bit of heat from the herb spread and crispiness from the fried pancetta. It makes me want to come back and try the other morning options. The mocha was well made as well.

Waitstaff came over multiple times to clear the table before we were done. We were also told to hurry up as the next table was arriving at 8.15pm and we were asked to leave.  We skipped the dessert.

By day, the space is compact and industrial--not much ambiance, but efficient for a quick morning jolt of coffee or a fresh meal during the work day. Their breakfast/lunch menu is concise, but they execute it very well. The ""beans and greens"" soup had a savory, bright broth--perfect to mop up with their grilled in-house bread. The Caesar salad was damn impressive. The kitchen transformed this normally-generic salad into a starring dish--a plate of sharp green escarole fully mixed with a kicky Caesar dressing, accompanied by seasoned croutons and whole anchovies. I'm eager to return for their breakfast offerings, and their location is close in the city for both campus students and civil servants.

Tasting notes:
Barbecue chicken sandwich: sauce to chicken ratio made it mess-free and flavorful; pickled slaw was a thin layer on top of the juicy chicken for a sour kick; bun was fluffy and soft with just enough of a chew to hold its structure
Potatoes: skin is delicate with a slight crispiness, a snappy exterior for a piping hot, tender, melt-in-your-mouth interior; accompanying oil is light and fragrant but does not overwhelm the flavor of the potato itself

Other thoughts:
-Love that there are hot savory sandwiches as well as assorted pastries available 
-Music is a little bit louder than background, and there is a bit of clanging and coffee machine whirring
-Outlets available by most tables, but no wifi 

A solid study spot, will come back also to try their dinner since it'll probably be a whole different feel!",6
9pn2fCiOvmBqErECwAau_w,_qgqa4X1OiMLqub1hHaMjg,4.0,2017-09-22 17:55:32,"Things I liked about dinner at Res Ipsa: 

-Small dining area: the cafe/restaurant is an unassuming plain white room that can seat no more than 20 to 30 people. The large windows in the front of the building are welcoming, but in the evening allowed for a dimly lit intimate experience.  It was never too loud or too quiet. Bring your parents, bring a friend (but only one or two bc it's a small place), bring a date! The atmosphere works for all. 

-Service: the service was excellent. Our waitress was friendly and knew the menu enough to answer all of the questions we had. She provided suggestions on what would pair well. Our table was small, but never cluttered with excess plates. Food delivery was staggered so we could try and appreciate one plate before moving on to the next. 

-BYO: duh. 

-Menu: the menu was small (which I liked. I was not overwhelmed with endless options). There were house-made pastas, lots of words I did not recognize and options to get either 2 oz or 4 oz portioned dishes. We decided to go with a starter of eggplant caponata and two  smaller portions for our entrees, the fazzoletti and the strascinatti. The eggplant was delicious. The fazzoletti was delicious. The strascinatti was delicious! Spicy sausage!! Maybe the pasta was a little too thick. Still great. Initially we thought we were going to have to order more because the portions were small, but because our food came out staggered, we ate slowly and enjoyed each bite. I ended up being surprisingly full (??!!?!) by the time I finished my last bite of the second plate.  
I would have liked to try the chocolate mousse, but maybe next time.

I would suggest making reservations at least a week in advance (I did and I couldn't even get the time that I wanted). 

Five stars because I couldn't think of anything I disliked.",1

I stopped in here for coffee and a place to study and found this to be a great cafe in terms of the quality of the coffee and also as a space to get some work done. The space is tiny and maybe only 20 or so people can fit inside, but every table pretty much has an outlet and the chairs and tables are an appropriate height and everything. 

As happens when you're studying, I got a little hungry, and thankfully Res Ipsa also offers great assortment of fresh pastries and a few lunch sandwiches and salads, freshly made in house and to order, and at reasonable prices. I tried the grilled eggplant sandwich, and it was terrific. The eggplant was cooked perfectly and it was a nice, fat slice to actually satiate you even though it's vegetarian. Moreover, the sauce and bun (I think also made in house) were perfect: the sauce was bright and flavorful and the bun was perfect. 

I need to try Res Ipsa for dinner sometime very soon, since the dinner menu looks amazing and also really well-priced. 

I recommend this place and can't wait to return!",3

This place has been on Philly's top 50 list for a while so I knew we needed to try it. It's BYOB which is always a plus!! Made a reservation in advance for dinner (usually completely booked & I don't think they take walk-ins). When we walked in at 5:28pm they told us we needed to go back out and stand outside until 5:30 which I thought was extremely bizarre. Maybe it's a legal issue? I'm not sure. 

Anyways, once we sat down we were warmly greeted by our waiter. He was helpful in steering us in the right direction on the menu. We decided to order 2 apps, 3 half pastas and 1 entree. Most of the food was good, nothing where I felt like I needed to go back and eat it again but it was good. I did think the potato dish and the fish were exceptional. 

Apps: Chicken Liver Mousse & potatoes

Pasta: Gnocchi Sardi, Orecchiette, and Strascinati

Entree: Fish

I think it's the most deceiving restaurant in the city, you would never know the incredible meal awaiting you by looking at the low-key simple space. But perhaps you would know, because it's getting harder and harder to get a dinner reservation!
The soft light in the evening really changes the space to be warmer and cozier than it is during the breakfast and lunch hours. I have stopped by for coffee in the morning and empanadas for lunch, and my husband raves about the breakfast sandwiches, but we had never been for dinner until we went with friends last night.
We all ordered the chefs menu ($50) and had course after course of taste bud tantalizing dishes. Started with the eggplant camponata which looked like an hillside covered in grass, due to the hairy dill arranged on top, it was amazing - scooped it all up with grilled bread, YUM! Then the roasted cauliflower dish, and zucchini dish..and the last appetizer was the octopus, wow!!!! I've never been an octopus lover, but this brought me to the other side, it was also beautifully presented. 4 pastas, all SO GOOD! My favorites were the wide noodle citrus dish (fazzoletti), and the bucatini with a garlic rabe type of sauce. The mains were sea bass (with head on), and tender chicken coated in a sweet glaze, all exquisite! By this time we were full, but hey, we are troopers and had to persevere, ha ha.. lastly 2 deserts, a peach salad and sunning delicious semolina cake.The semolina cake was the big bang at the end of the entire meal, it was food-art - beautifully presented with cream polka dots in a berry pond surrounding an island cake topped with dollops of fruit compote and a nutty walkway down the center. I think a little smurf would happily live on that island.. however the island was quickly photographed then devoured in .3 seconds. 
Almost forgot to mention, the chef, Michael Vincent Ferreri came out and visited our table. I love that! He is doing great work, this place blew me away! Go! And don't forget your wine, it's a BYOB!",8

Having been at Res Ipsa for dinner, breakfast, and lunch multiple times, I can confidently confirm this is a true gem worth experiencing definitely sooner than later when naturally chef Michael and his team will be harder to reach.

Dinner is by far my favorite of their services and the appetizers for sure the show stopper. My favorites so far has been the lamb tartare with anchovy aioli, pine nuts, herbs and greens on a burnt semolina bread and the chef grandmother's original eggplant caponata. Chances are though you won't find the same dish. The team makes new dishes with whatever ingredient they can find the most fresh, that being sweet, macerated from nature, strawberries, octopus, tomatoes, plums, and the list goes on. Speaking about fresh we had the luck to visit shortly after the restaurant received fresh anchovies straight from the Mediterranean. There is something truly dignified and romantic about a chef who gets genuinely excited about something as simple as a dish of house cured anchovies with olives. Best of all some of these dishes are little gifts from the chef.

The rest of the dinner menu does not follow that heavy of a rotation as we've seen with the starters. The menu includes a core of pasta dishes that vary on their ""toppings"" (?) from time to time and the option of (perfectly cooked, herbed and filleted) whole fish or sweet and sour grilled chicken, followed by very good desserts. The only thing that is certain is that the team has mastered Italian flavors and whatever risk they take comes out as complete success with very few exceptional misses.

I can use three more paragraphs to explain how amazingly friendly, professional, and approachable everyone in the staff is from the servers to chef Michael who does the extra mile to interact with his patrons, but will just rely on saying that we always feel spoiled leaving the restaurant.

!!!
Some key notes for the yelp user:
* The place does not offer WiFi despite the Yelp business info section so it is a little bit less work friendly than most cafes
* Their website menu is naturally outdated. Dishes, mostly starters, rotate heavily, especially during summer. Just trust that everything is delicious and walk in or see the menu that they post by their door.
* The place is not just a cafe despite the Yelp classification. It is a -purely Italian- cafe in the day, BYOB restaurant at night. Therefore the ambience and decoration is multipurpose as well. It works perfectly for me. But be warned if you don't find it either to be elegant enough for a restaurant or cosy enough for a cafe
* In a similar spirit the place is probably not your typical $ joint. Food quality is amazing but comes with reasonable price. Actually it comes at a great value for money deal. You might find the breakfast sandwich slightly small or a bit expensive. I find it excessively delicious but just be warned
My belief is that the profile that emerges from the Yelp page misclassifies how amazing this place is. Definitely give it a try if delicious, creative, and authentic Italian food at a very friendly setting on a very reasonable price sounds like a good deal",3

Expect a simple selection of 4 or 5 breakfast options, but don't let the menu's brevity fool you... the food and flavors are excellent! The breakfast sandwich on english muffin is a great place to start. Add spinach for a perfect dose of healthy flavor and texture... the seasonings ensure this is not your fathers spinach. Pair breakfast with a ginger molasses cookie - a must try. It's massive, and packed with just the right amount of sweet spicy ginger and bitter molasses. $3.00 is a steal for that chunk of heaven. Coffee selection is standard with a fun option, a real maple syrup latte. Great flavor combination. For mochas they use Hershey's chocolate syrup, so expect more sweet, less bitter. 
Lunch offers another simple menu. The green tomato sandwich and whitefish sandwich hit the spot for us with thoughtful flavors and textures making each an experience. The chicken sandwich was more on the boring side, with nothing standing out. Each came with a bowl of the most wonderful pingpong ball sized potatoes that must have been baked/fried in a bit of savory bacon fat or something equally gluttonous, because they rocked! 
While the food brought plenty of smiles and delight, the service was a bit on the chilly side. The two front end staff members kept busy on their smart phones while the self-clean up station nearly overflowed with customers' empty plates, and later, as we ate, one young man stayed the tables around us with cleaner, ignoring how unappetizing it is for diners to inhale spray cleaner while trying to enjoy lunch.

Given the treacherous parking situation in CC, we decided to purchase something at CVS and park in their lot (is this illegal?). We hurried over to the cafe in the freezing cold and made it in. By that time, some people were getting up and we were able to get seats for four (self-seating, I believe). We walked up to the menu, which is pretty limited and ordered as four: house made english muffin with butter and jam (great), a foccacia (so-so), tomato soup/grilled cheese (pricey for $8), two egg an cheese sandwiches (one sausage, one pancetta; go with the latter for sure), a coffee and a latte. All in all, over $40 in food for what seemed to essentially be small snacks. It was a quick meal but wasn't anything mind blowing.

However. And a big however. 

Our post dinner coffee had just arrived and after we handed off the checkbook with a generous tip, our server returned to inform us that the next party was waiting for our table. In the moment it wasn't too strange, but after she walked away I realized we both had just been served cortados and had each only had a sip, not to mention we both had full glasses of wine. It was a Friday night dinner and we had only been there for an hour and fourty five minutes, which for a coursed meal seemed reasonable if not short. We both immediately felt rushed and did as we were asked, quickly drank our coffee and wine and left, though my girlfriend did ask the server what time the reservation was for the party waiting on our table, which was 7:45, basically giving an airtight window for serving us (our reservation was for 6).

If I read this review, I would likely be focused more on the food reviews and less on the service, which is entirely fair. But when you eat at a place that is supposed to be contending with top restaurants in the city it diminishes the experience when the last experience is being rushed off immediately after paying the check. Had we any forewarning we might not have had coffee, or skipped the appetizers. I know the poor scheduling is not the fault of our server, but she kept us in the dark and only informed us after we had paid the check which, whether intentional or not, made us feel a little conned.

This place has a tremendous reputation, and for almost all of our meal, that lived up. But being young and having too many friends in service (also my girlfriend who ate with me worked in service for years), the service tonight was downright deceptive. We spent too much time talking to our server about food for her to tell us we needed to hurry up as we handed her cash (literally what happened).

For now: Res Ipsa delivers well enough on food and the small atmosphere of a traditional byob. But the service is well below the cost. Not only were we hurried, the party taking our seat had no room to wait comfortably and were forced to stand in the doorway while we chugged our coffee and wine. It was probably the most awkward experience I've had at a restaurant, and for that I can only give them 2 stars.",2

This is a place that makes you feel ""cool"" as a patron. Between the ambience, the music, the ""it's just a coffee shop that happens to serve the some of the best food in Philly"", the ""yeah we do a tasting menu but of COURSE we are BYOB...""

We opted for the $60 tasting which was certainly worth it to try a bunch off the menu, but the pasta portions definitely felt small. I still honestly felt a bit hungry at the end of the meal! It came with a tomato dish, grilled octopus, a clam pasta, eggplant bucatini and an orchiette pasta finished off with a chocolatey dessert. Nothing was too heavy. We chose the fish for our entree. Maybe it was my mistake for not choosing a larger size pasta dish... but I felt like for a tasting menu, the portions could have been a bit more generous for $60. Also, the BYO is cute but doesn't exactly air the price of the menu. At exactly 2 hours after our reservation, we were interrupted by our waitress telling us the other party arrived. Probably would have been better to tell us at the start of our meal, since that left a bad taste in our mouth to feel rushed.

However, it was very small. I ordered the spicy chicken salad sandwich and it was just okay. It definitely was not spicy although the pickles added some nice flavor to the sandwich.  This sandwich is perfectly sized for when you're not THAT hungry but it's enough to hold you over.",1

Let me explain, Coffee / breakfast joint in the morning with artisan type breakfast foods, by 11am it turns into a delectable lunch spot where you can still get a few breakfast items/bakery items and then at night it transforms into a restaurant that you need reservations weeks in advance to score! Is this real life or am I in a dream state I ask you?

The coffee is very good. I did not try there market price single origin coffee that was $5 for a pour over but I had a cup of there drip coffee which honesty scored a perfect 10 and I have been drinking coffee since the age of 5 so I take my coffee tasting experience very, very seriosly. (Tip - they will make you cream as they put out only milk at the mixing station).

I ordered the Meat Calzone which consisted of spicy pepperoni and I want to say a feta type cheese. The unique characteristic of there calzones is that it is soft and not hard/too doughy like the traditional calzone. The chicken sandwich I took a bite of and this had a firey grilled taste to it and very good. The chicken sandwich is accompanied by potatoes that have a chili flavor to them and pack quite the punch.

I can't wait to come back and try more of there items and I will certainly be trying there single origin coffee in the not too distant future to update my review. As always people SYOY!!!",2

Having read some of the reviews, I was a bit surprised with the service we received...the servers were perfectly ""nice"" (we had two, which I found strange) but the vibe was just super snobby in a we're-hipster-and-you're-not kind of way. 

I asked at the beginning if it was possible to switch to another table and was told that it wasn't possible because of the way the schedule was organized. Then, my friend and I ordered two half portions of pasta and was asked ""are you sure? How hungry are you? You should order more because this isn't a lot"". We said we weren't too hungry and that maybe we'd add to the order later if it wasn't enough. The server immediately said, ""oh no, we only take complete orders because our kitchen is small and can't handle it otherwise"". I've never heard this before and I eat out A LOT. Well, their loss if they want to lose out on more money I guess? 

The food was good, we had the spaghetti vongole and the orecchiette with beans (heirloom, obvi). The spaghetti came with a bunch of clams and we were excited to dig in...only to find that the clams were mainly empty. We probably had about 2 or 3 pieces of clam meat each? I briefly mentioned this to the (other) server, who then went on to explain to me that they cook the clams with the shells in the broth and so the meat sometimes falls out. Um, I'm aware of how that works, but maybe next time don't serve a bunch of empty shells?

Overall the whole experience kinda felt like one long mansplaining event that left both of us weirded out. Although the food was decent, I wouldn't return if that's the ambiance I'm gonna receive. This restaurant appealed to us law school nerds because of the name, but I don't agree that it speaks for itself...",2

I ordered a breakfast sandwich on the house english muffin, with added spinach and a side of potatoes. The sandwich was really good: a perfect frittata with really flavorful salsa verde and just enough cheese to tie it all together. However, the potatoes were my favorite part! They were crispy and coated with more salsa verde and chili oil.

We were very disappointed with how rushed we were by the staff.  From the moment we sat down to the moment we left we felt like all they wanted was for us to get out.  The food was good small portions but I barely remember it because of how quickly we were pushed through our meal. Because of the poor service we left a 15% tip.  About 20 minutes after we left we got a call from the manager asking us why we left such a low tip because ""they are not accustomed to that"".  We explained that the food was good but the service was poor.  The manager said that he didn't believe that his staff shouldn't be punished for being tentative on a very busy Friday night where they need to turn the table.

You can get a breakfast sandwich with pancetta (essentially bacon) or sausage (can also add spinach). This sammy was extremely delicious! You can tell its high quality ingredients. There is also some sort of green spicy pesto involved which was a great addition. But you should know its quite small....and perhaps a touch overpriced at $6.50 but I would still order again! I got a cinnamon role type of pastry which I also thought was a touch over prices ($4) and tasted a bit off to me, almost like a sourdough or yeast aftertaste? Maybe just not my speed. They only had raw sugar for coffee which seemed odd...nothing against raw sugar but I hate how it sinks to the bottom of your drink. When I asked for splenda (I know its bad for me) they looked at me like I had 4 heads and said they were out of it, which is strange since the place has only been open a few days.

Also, this place is so affordable: sandwich with sausage, potatoes, and coffee for $12. 

Breakfast sandwich, big deal right? But the English muffin is freshly made and is perfect. I hate the Thomas English muffins you can get in the store, but these are orders of magnitude better. The egg is actually a slice of a flavorful frittata. And if you opt for the fennel sausage (which you should), it's perfectly seasoned and complements all the flavors in all the right ways. 

And, do get those potatoes on the side. They are the perfect accompaniment. So crisp, so flavorful, and cooked perfectly.

And, the salsa verde comes on both and is a flavor amplifier. It's salty, herbaceous, and has a slight acidity to it.",1

Looks like a small cafe and seems to carry different vibes during the day and at night. Cute minimalist cafe by day, and lounge-y by night. I went with a friend and did the chef's tasting. She had gone before and it was my first. These were the dishes that were brought out to us the night we went and my thoughts about each dish:

Cauliflower app - pretty good and presented beautifully. Really well balanced in its seasoning/flavor. Ties for favorite app with the octopus dish
Octopus - really good amount and large chunks of octopus in the dish
Blood orange dish - Was lacking a bit of something I feel but overall was still enjoyable and refreshing to eat
Gnocchi sardi - My favorite of the pasta dishes we received. Gnocchi wasn't super soft or fluffy but was still very good and definitely had that home made taste and look
Orecchiette - I thought this pasta dish was a bit bland and not very exciting to eat
Spaghetti a la vongole - Pretty standard spaghetti dish and I was also not that impressed by this pasta dish
Roasted chicken w/ agrodolce sauce - EXCELLENT. Very very moiste and the sauce it is served with is amazing. 
There was also a dessert but I forget what it exactly was so I won't comment. Definitely had a good crunch to it though.

Overall, the appetizers were good and the pasta dishes kind of fell short for me. When I think back on this meal the chicken definitely takes the cake and everyone should go try it. I'll also have to go back for their daytime cafe menu!",1
T0HeE3cSudojoN1l8uFJ6w,_qgqa4X1OiMLqub1hHaMjg,5.0,2020-02-10 17:55:41,"Res Ispa Cafe is a tiny little BYOB spot. I went with a group of coworkers on a Thursday night at 6 PM. We made a reservation ahead of time, however, it was not crowded when we arrived.

I am a serial menu stalker, I spend my whole day preparing for a meal out by looking at the menu and photos of food to decide what I'll order. I was surprised, and a bit scared, by how small the menu is at Res Ispa. I can be picky, so I was worried that I would not enjoy this pick. I was WRONG.

Our waitress was awesome and explained everything is intended to be shared, but we could order however we preferred. We started with the Cauliflower. When it came out, it was not at all what I had expected. It is cut up into a small cake shape like a tartare and has chopped hazelnut, trout roe, and arugula. This was a delicious combination of salty and sweet. It came with two different sauces and we were told to mix everything together before digging in. It tasted great with the complimentary bread.

For pasta, we had the small portions of the trofie, bucatini, and spaghetti alle vongole. These portions were enough for each of us to have a few bites of each pasta dish. My favorite was the spaghetti alle vongole. I don't like clams, so I skipped them, but the white wine sauce was SO good. Our wonderful server brought us more bread so we could dip into the leftover pasta sauces. 

For our ""main"" we had the whole size of the roasted chicken. This may have been the most delicious chicken I've ever eaten in my entire life. It was definitely the meal highlight. The portion was huge and came with a side of the most incredible potatoes and veggies. The chicken itself had an incredible agrodolce sauce. This was the perfect mix of sweet and acidic. It was so simple but complemented the chicken perfectly! We asked how the chicken was cooked because it was so good and learned that it was brined. This is a MUST if you are looking at reviews before going to Res Ispa. Seriously, do not miss this.

For dessert, we tried a poppy cake with persimmon jam, and a chocolate mousse with almond and coconut. They were the perfect way to end this amazing meal!",2
Nx7tiHlS-rel082BWbXoDQ,_qgqa4X1OiMLqub1hHaMjg,3.0,2017-02-28 14:23:04,"I had a stunningly good cafe latte here this morning.  Carefully prepared and beautifully presented.  It had a smooth and rich texture which did not require any sugar.  Lattes are often bitter or have a bitter after taste.  Not here!  Service was very pleasant and the atmosphere in this small cafe is simple but elegant with marble tables.  Nice touch!
I had a good breakfast sandwich consisting of egg, polenta, basil, garlic, olive oil, and some pancetta which as another reviewer pointed out, ""makes everything taste good""!  I would describe the breakfast sandwich as needing to ""evolve"" a bit.  It was okay but needs some tweaks.  Not sure the English muffin is the best choice.  Needs more crunch.  Polenta is a fine idea but needs to be warmed more.  Pancetta--bravo!  Overall, B+, but could be an A!",3

I went to Res Ipsa for dinner with some friends and we tried the tasting menu option ($60 per person), which consists of a family-style meal of four appetizers, four pastas, an entree and dessert. All of the dishes were simple and well-executed, but my favorites were the cauliflower with trout roe and a beautiful gnocchi with eggplant, tomato sauce and a bIte of chili. Entree choice is either a whole roasted chicken or half-chicken with a whole fish. We opted for the latter. The chicken was melt-in-your-mouth perfectly cooked and the fish was tender and fresh. The only disappointment was the linguine with clams. This is apparently Res Iowa's signature dish, but it tasted like an number of versions of this dish I've tried at other Italian restaurants. Not bad at all -- just not that special. Service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. BYOB. Highly recommended.",0

They just didn't hit the mark for me as being one of the top 10 restaurants in the city.  It was good- yes.  The dining experience was unique- yes.  I would go back- yes. But something was missing.  I would really love to come back and see what more they have to offer in terms of experience and food.  

Some positives:  I loved the casual atmosphere that Res Ipsa has created.  They make you feel welcome and relaxed, like a casual neighborhood restaurant serving really good food.  I also appreciate that they are BYOB--it keeps the price down and allows guests to enjoy their own bottle of wine with their food.  The food was good (I could stretch my imagination and say great but again, something was missing).

Appetizers: We had all of the vegetable appetizers on the menu and they were all good. The Mushroom Caponata was one of the most notable appetizers that stood out to me and has to be one of the best dishes I have had in Philly.  The Cauliflower was also enjoyed at our table, it was not my favorite. The Blood Orange was okay but not something all too memorable. 

Mains: If I had to select 1 pasta to get again it would be the Fazoletti--It was unique and decadent.  The full size was a good serving for 4 people and it stood out as one of the better dishes throughout our meal. Spaghetti Alle Vongole was pasta with clams, again, nothing I'd sit and write home about; somewhat disappointing given it being one of their signature dishes. It was lackluster in flavor and left me wanting something more unique. 

Fish: The whole fish with vegetables was really the star of the show.  This fish was cooked perfectly and was both decadent and unique.  The vegetables were an nice added touch that our table certainly enjoyed.  If you go to Res Ipsa, make sure to get the fish or chicken.  You won't be disappointed.",0

No, this is not the end of the world. But I'm just surprised each time I try again and this same problem keeps coming up.

It's intimate with tables tightly placed next to each other and the walls are sparsely decorated. It doesn't give the feel of an upscale restaurant or really very homey, but rather a bit sterile. However all my thoughts about where i was sitting melted away the second the food got to our table because these chefs are brilliant. 

We opted for the tasting menu where we split 3 appetizers, 3 pastas, an entree, and a dessert. The tasting menu is a ton of food, we were full before we even got the entree so the majority of that came home in a to go container. Each dish was fresh, flavorful and presented beautifully. Even the olive oil was thoughtfully plated. The major standouts were the octopus appetizer, every pasta (pesto, gnocchi sardi, spaghetti alle vongole), and the chicken entree. You can't go wrong here.

All this and it's BYOB. Get reservations while you can because Res Ipsa is already all over the food news and it's only going to get bigger.",3
QJb56tgWxNu3KBPmppJWPg,_qgqa4X1OiMLqub1hHaMjg,5.0,2017-07-31 22:32:03,"""I might be addicted to your breakfast sandwich. I've been here 10 times already."" I said to the manager
""It's not a bad thing to be addicted to"" she smiled back reassuringly.
 She's likely right on that one. But, as a croissantphile, I blame Res Ipsa (abbreviated Latin for ""the thing that speaks for itself"") for starting my current obsession... with breakfast sandwiches.   

I keep reading reviews praising Res Ipsa's sandwich as a great Mc-Muffin-like breakfast sandwich. Sorry? I mean, I understand the individual words in that sentence, but collectively? No comprende, señor. You start with the excellent house-baked English muffin, add to it a light and fluffy square of frittata topped with melting Asiago and an exceptional herbal and spicy kick from cilantro, lemon, and long hots. I've heard some customers find it too spicy, but I hope they keep the zing. Few things can awaken one's taste buds and senses early morning than a tease of heat, accented by great coffee (expected given the folks behind Re-animator). The sandwich is perfect of itself and at $4.50 a steal. The only way I could praise it higher would be if they had other meat options for the optional fennel laced sausage. Having tried a version at the excellent Hungry Pigeon, I've renewed appreciation for that add-on. Instead, I've been ordering a side of the fried potatoes, also spiked by salsa verde and chili oil.

Res Ipsa is another one of the all-day cafes that start from coffee and breakfast, and undergo multiple personality changes during the day. In this case, Res Ipsa is an exceptional Italian-ish byob at night serving some of the best pasta in Philly. Everyone who loves food should be thrilled by their half-plate portion sizes as it allows one to sample broadly, as I have. Yes, I have weighed (pun intended) the reviews critical of their pasta portion sizes. There might be some merit to that, but I've never gone home hungry, given the complimentary house-made semolina bread (I love the texture!). Then again, for me no meal is complete without dessert, and I'd always make room for Res Ipsa's chocolate mousse that's meant for adult appreciation - given how smoothly it brings together elements like dark chocolate, olive oil, cherry, hazelnut, candied orange. One of the best versions I've had lately.

But, if size is what really matters to you, you might consider going instead to the capable Little Nonna's and enjoy heaped servings. At Res Ipsa, however, you will experience pastas that truly wow you with the basics and flourishes. The fried eggplant in the slowly smoldering heat of the Arrabiata might as well be butter, and the unembellished gnocchi is rapturous. The trofie pesto pasta may look unassuming, but has a real depth to its flavor. Even the pasta con sarde surprised me, not because, as the manager helpfully reminded, sardines can be hit or miss for people - but because I focused more on the spices and wasn't annoyed by the raisins... only Garfield can best me in my distaste for raisins...

It might appear that lunch is their weakest link, but I'm glad to note that they've been adding sandwich options to the excellent eggplant sandwich, and spicy chicken sandwich: an avocado toast, a fried green tomato sandwich, and a BLT. So, that works to address any concerns I had on that count. I worry about their success because this stretch of Walnut Street is not known to be hospitable to restaurants.

But, over and above anything, Res Ipsa is special because of its excellent team. Starting from the morning staff who are patient and polite while bringing over your food. To the chef who came over to greet an elderly couple sitting on the table next to me, recognizing them from his past life. Even though the lady initially failed to recognize him, he handled the entire episode with a lot of class... Most of all, it's the charming manager, who spends time having real conversations with all the guests. I say ""real"" for she stays present in the moment and thinks on her feet, even with my half-mumbling deadpan humor...

""...What is essential is invisible to the eye"" (Little Prince) ... would be my (pretentiously philosophical) response to ""the thing that speaks for itself.""  (4.5 stars rounded up for stellar service).",13

Came here as a walk in on a Thursday night and immediately went for he tasting menu. I won't go through every dish but suffice to say that the majority of the dishes here were hits, especially the pastas. 

I really enjoyed the asparagus dish which was enjoyably cold and had a great texture with the egg yolk. The octopus was another stand out, although I wish we were given more than one tentacle. Pastas for the most part were great. I was really impressed by the trofie al pesto with nutty flavor but soft texture. Unfortunately the spaghetti a la vongole fell short; too much salt and a little bit too much wine for my liking.  The chicken, the lone entree, also fell short of expectation. The bird was a little tough to eat as I think it as undercooked and maybe a little raw. My girlfriend was scared to eat it but the potatoes included with the dish were on point. 

I'd probably come back and order a la carte just to pig out on pasta. Keep in mind that this place is BYOB so make sure to bring your best bottle and enjoy!",0

The ambiance is bare bones- it's just a small room with about 8 tables and the kitchen. It was so cramped that people coming in and out and trying to put on/take off jackets caused traffic jams and clothing grazing people's faces. 

My group decided on the tasting menu which includes 3 apps, 3 pastas, 1 entree, and 2 desserts for $60 per person. They did ask if you wanted anything specific or if there was anything you wanted omitted. We ended up with a salad, cauliflower, octopus, gnocchi, spaghetti with clams, orecchiette, and chicken. The portions were small except for the chicken which we ended up taking to go and just the leftovers filled two boxes to the brim. 

The stand out items were the cauliflower, octopus, gnocchi, and spaghetti. The bread and olive oil was also a hit and we requested more to dip in the pasta sauces. The sauce/ au jus on the chicken was really tasty and the chicken was perfectly cooked. It came with a side of vegetables including crispy potatoes and greens all very well seasoned. 

The dessert included chocolate mouse on an almond and coconut tart and is really the only one worth mentioning. The other was a special- almond cake with fruit and an herbed olive oil. It went to waste.

Overall the food was good but I am not itching to go back anytime soon.",1

My fiance and I set up a special date night at Res Ipsa because I'd been wanting to go for a while.  Our reservation was for 8:15 on a Friday night.  We planned carefully and purposefully arrived hungry, eager to indulge in the tasting menu.  The entryway to the restaurant is tight and crowded, but once we managed to elbow our way up to a host, we were told that we would need to wait 5-10 minutes for another table to finish up.  The host advised that we grab a drink at the taco joint next door, which we decided we would do, and he promised to text us.

We enjoyed drinks at the taco place while drooling over the smell of fajitas and coveting the nachos the couple next to us at the bar was sharing.  Having heard nothing from Res Ipsa in over half an hour, my fiance walked back next door to check in while I kept our seats warm.  Upon inquiry, he was informed that there had been a mix up of some sort with our table, but we could be seated in another few minutes.  We settled up at the bar and headed back next door -- very, very hungry at this point.

The staff at Res Ipsa straightforwardly acknowledged their mistake and sincerely apologized, which we appreciated.  We ordered quickly since we already knew we wanted the tasting menu, and fortunately it did not take terribly long for the first few courses to come out.  Unfortunately, it was well past 9 p.m. at that point and we were each several drinks in because we had also had planned pre-dinner cocktails before arriving at Res Ipsa/hitting the taco bar next door.

The food was absolutely fantastic.  Whatever else you do, make sure you get the chicken!  We took Craig Laban's suggestion in this regard and he certainly did not steer us wrong.  Our server also brought us an extra pasta dish to make up for the extra 50 mins wait, which was a nice gesture.  The problem, however, was that by the time the entree arrived, it was close to 10 p.m. on a Friday night after a long work week and several glasses of wine; by then I had reached the point where I was so tired and hungry that I just about lost my appetite and wanted to go home (does that ever happen to anyone else?).  We'd looked forward to our reservation well in advance and I'd eaten light all day in preparation for the lauded tasting menu, but when everything got pushed back by nearly an hour, I ended up much more hangry and exhausted than I'd hoped I would be for this experience.

The only other slight problem I had with the experience was that I was sitting in a corner booth seat that got a lot of glare from a tall fluorescent lamp post across Walnut St.  The ambience of Res Ipsa should be pretty nice and relaxing, but I was having a hard time ignoring that ugly glare.  Perhaps a different seat would have helped.

I would certainly go back to Res Ipsa; the tasting menu is one of the best I've had in a while and a steal at only $65pp.  Of course, I also love that it is a BYO.  Another big plus of the evening was discovering Rosy's Taco Bar next door, which seems like a cool spot worth visiting again.  I wish I could give it 5 stars, but a 50 min wait for a reserved table is not acceptable in a restaurant of this caliber, and unfortunately that wait significantly detracted from my overall experience.",2

It was my husband's birthday dinner, so we opted for the chef's tasting menu (a steal, in my opinion, for $60/person). I'm usually kind of particular about my food choices but everything on the menu looked delicious so I was down for letting the chefs decide. We were not disappointed! 

We started with three plates featuring zucchini, heirloom tomatoes and fried mussels. Each dish was better than the last, and the flavors of summer on the east coast were bursting with every bite. 

Next up we had three pasta dishes, plus a smaller bonus dish which offered a bite-sized taste of a fourth pasta. The pastas varied as did the sauces, which covered the gamut from pesto to simple garlic and wine with clams. 

You are given a choice of roasted chicken or whole fish as your entree. We did dinner at Res Ipsa about a year ago and remembered the whole fish fondly, so that was a no brainer. The fish was a mild white fish (dorade, I think?) and it was deboned perfectly. It was topped with salsa verde and served with a hearty side of vegetables, all of which were delicious and certainly not treated as an afterthought to the main course. 

Last but not least, we received a dessert (with a candle!) to share. It was a fruit tart with the most delicious crust. The perfect ending to a perfect meal. If Res Ipsa has been on your to-try list, make a reservation and enjoy!",15

We got the breakfast sandwich with a side of the potatoes. 

The sandwich is served on a English muffin and is quite tasty. My wife got her's with spinach. No complaints here as it's pretty good and satisfies that egg sandwich craving. 

We would definitely come back. The potatoes were quite good and the iced coffee that we got was very good! The place is really nice, and they do egg sandwiches really well!",1

I'd also heard their dinner is great, so when I walked in, I was in shock that the tiny coffee shop could transform into a formal dining area in the evenings. 

It was still really busy during the day, although most people stopping in just ordered a coffee to go. You can definitely set up your laptop and work in the space, too. They had plugs in convenient locations for customers. I needed to order my food to go, which I was a little worried about initially. They were completely fine with that, and actually packaged my food really, really well to carry in tupperware and in a bag. 

I ordered the breakfast sandwich with fennel sausage with a side of potatoes and coffee. It was so, so good! It's basically an oxymoron, but it was one of the fanciest breakfast sandwiches I've ever had. The potatoes were also really good, nicely cooked, with great spices and flavoring. I think the highlight of the sandwich is really the asiago cheese. It makes the sandwich in my opinion. I'd definitely come back to try the dinner experience and even the tasting menu!",3

But.... the dinner! So, the tables are a bit crowded and the noises do echo. But, look past that and try all the food. We got the tasting menu and it was one of the best meals I have had in a while. It started with a salad (fine). The celery root caponata was delicious and I loved all the textures. The octopus and lentil was phenomenal. I could have eaten that for a whole meal. 
Loved every bite of each of the pastas. Each was cooked to perfection and while rich, nothing was heavy. I loved how herbaceous the clams and spaghetti was. I'm not an eggplant fan and this pasta was amazing. 
We got the fish as the entree and it was perfectly cooked. Again, fresh and herbaceous! Loved it.... and the sides--those were some amazing potatoes! 
Yes I'll happily be back!!",5
k5VRWSzyp1aAGv2vp55njg,_qgqa4X1OiMLqub1hHaMjg,4.0,2019-11-26 01:41:21,"This is a breakfast/brunch Res Ipsa review and based on what I've read here, elsewhere and experienced, I'd like to try dinner.  For now, Res Ipsa's breakfast is a quaint, comfortable experience, with service that seems pleasant if not slightly flawed.  It's an unfortunate wart on an otherwise pleasant and enjoyable experience.  I'll still return.

Pros:

The food is pretty good.  My wife and I had dueling breakfast sandwiches served on buttery English muffins.  I had the fennel sausage while she had the bacon.  Sausage was the easy winner with a sweet spiciness that was delectable without being overpowering.  Each sandwich is served with a piece of frittata which was dense but still fluffy.  The bacon was hidden and somewhat disappointing.

The potatoes were a smashed buttery experience that included a heavier spice than I expected, but I really enjoyed!  Be prepared, they're a little spicy.

Additionally, we noshed on an almond croissant prior to breakfast which was simultaneously flaky and gooey.  It made a huge mess but every bite was delicious! 

The ambiance was pleasant, comfortable and included self-poured bottled tap water (heh), self-busing and (essentially) self-service. They do seem to generally walk over food to numbered placards handed out at the counter.

Prices were on par with the area and similar upscale coffee shops.

Service was friendly and apologetic (see below).

Cons:

Their ordering system with a square machine (or something similar) still has something to be desired.  It seemed like just two young women were working and were overwhelmed by a large crowd.  They confused our order (possibly my fault for ordering the same exact thing as my wife except sausage over bacon).  It was possibly my fault. In any event, they were extremely apologetic and polite!

Coffee was mediocre.  For a place that gives off an upscale coffee vibe, the coffee was bitter yet weak (My Americano).  I found my wife's latte equally disappointing.  I wouldn't come here just for coffee.

Other notes:  They seem to be BYOB all day.  I cracked a beer at an 11am brunch w/o issue (and full encouragement!).  

Conclusion:  I'm not sure it's the best brunch stop, but it's a good one!  I think we'll make a quick stop again in the future when we're nearby.  But there are still better options.  Even at worst, I'm not sure one could be friendlier!",2
pTTYq_qarGaYrV2yqeGBSw,_qgqa4X1OiMLqub1hHaMjg,5.0,2018-01-08 17:28:38,"Res Ipsa lived up to the hype! This teeny tiny coffee shop is pumping out some insanely delicious eats. The breakfast sandwich was completely unlike any other I've had. Starting with the homemade english muffin and moving on to how they serve the eggs in frittata form, topped with asiago cheese. This keeps the sandwich from falling apart which I really appreciate. I added the sauteed spinach to my sandwich and it did not disappoint; it was a little drippy but not messy. 

The side of potatoes were crispy, crunchy baby potatoes, topped with just the right amount of salt and some chimichurri (or salsa verde?). Delicious! The coffee was great as well. 

I'm chomping at the bit to get back for dinner!",22

Big patio outside but often the tables inside are full.  No leather chairs for relaxing - it's all wooden chairs.  There is a bar area overlooking the parking lot and a giant shared picnic style table.

Service here is quick and efficient.  Drinks are good.  The cream/sugar area can be a bit untidy but in general it's fairly clean.

But for me they knew what I was saying and we're super helpful when I could not decide on a desert to eat. I ended up with a brownie warmed up and it was perfect for this cold day in YEG. 
I got a grande London fog half sweet and lactaid milk. It was made perfectly to my liking and nicely brewed.
My friend got a vente vanella latte and he really liked his too. 
Either way we sat here having good conversation and not a single issue. 
The only reason I'm not giving full stars is because the first lady who helped me seemed like she was misserable and not as kind.",0

It was pretty busy, but we found a table near the door we could sit at. I ordered a chamomille tea, whie he ordered a Passion Tea Lemonade. We sat down and waited patiently for our drinks to arrive. After over 5 minutes of waiting, I decided to go up to the barista counter to see if our drinks were there. Nothing. So I walked back up to the girl who took our order and she said pointed at three paper bags with pastries in them and said my order was there. I was confused but she was busy with a customer. So I waited until she was done with the customer and asked her where our order was. She snapped back that they'd be waiting at the barista counter. SO I walked back to the counter again to make sure I didn't miss it and still nothing was there. I was getting annoyed by now. Meanwhile, both girls working the barista machine couldn't be bothered to even look up to see why I was walking back and forth looking frustrated. I walked back to the girl at the register and  told her our drinks were there nor were they called out. She asked me what we ordered again, rolled her eyes and yelled at another girl behind the counter to make the passion tea lemonade. So I walked back to the barista side and waited for the drinks. The passion tea lemonade wasn't even shaken like it was supposed to be. All she did was pour the pre-made mix from the carton over a glass of ice and roughly put it on the counter. So I took it, annoyed, and brought it over to my boyfriend. No sooner had I sat down that I heard the girl at the register call out that my chamomille tea was ready, so I walked back again, and shehad placed it on the higher ledge (vs. the lower one where the barista girls put them). As I brought it down, I ended up spilling the tea all over my hand since it was so high. I was sooooo mad. Why did she put it up there in the first place? I was able to finally put a lid on it and walk back to the table where my boyfriend immediately asked me what happened. He felt so bad he used his cold iced drink to relieve the pain and throbbing from my hand. This incidence was the second Starbucks in the city I've had horrible service from. I am beyond done with this chain. Their sister chain, Teavana is WAY better in terms of customer service and product quality.  I will never visit this store again,",1

Well, that was a mistake, because DAAAAMN this place is good! So moral the story;  if it's a Friday or Saturday get your reservations,  'cause girl this place is worth it! 

We had a myriad of cocktails and they were all well balanced and delicious. Our waitress gave her honest opinion on the menu and all of the recommended items were on point! The portobello fries were the BEST I've ever had. The risotto was Smokey and full-bodied with the rice cooked to a creamy al dente. The short rib was a wonderful balance of sweet and salty. They were able to accommodate our request for a lobster free Mac and cheese that tbh was in my top ten all time best Mac and cheese. 

Definitely leave room for dessert, Il flotante was light and flavorful (add a splash of espresso for a truly decadent treat!). The white chocolate mousse was also wonderful, but pales in comparison to the refined and classic floating meringue. 

And like everyone else has said, the decor and ambiance are reminiscent of a speakeasy. Live music playing a neat combination of classics with reconfigured modern hits made for a truly memorable evening.

Our server Nick immediately greeted us at the table. A couple of our chairs were squishy and sank down a good bit - I felt like a little kid with the table at my neck (a little exaggeration there) and Nick swapped out mine and one other chair at the table.  :) Also, the table itself was a spinner....and quite wobbly. But never fear, Nick took care of that too!
The last 2 in our party finally arrived and although we had already chosen our drinks and discussed the Restaurant Week $45 prix fixe 3 course meal - because I have a few food issues, I needed to see what needed to be changed/substituted and although they don't do substitutions, they actually did accommodate me, which was absolutely perfect!  The only thing I couldn't have that I wanted off the choices was the dessert (I was very sad about that) and they offered me something else.

I ordred a Brown Derby which was a bourbon drink and was absolutely delish!  They substituted grapefruit juice with orange and it was fantastic!

My choices from the prix fixe menu were the black rice croquettes, the short rib and my dessert was substituted from the chocolate pretzel bread pudding to the merengue.

The black rice croquettes were really tasty and the dipping sauce, which I normally can't have sauces, but only had a tiny dab of, was really wonderful!  I shared that with someone who had the angeled eggs which were picked beet, mushroom and I cannot recall the last one - but all 3 were very tasty.

The short rib was very tasty and served over mashed potatoes.  Unfortunately it was a little tough and a little too much fat.

My substitute dessert (merengue) wasn't quite as tasty as I had hoped.  But the cream or sauce it was floating in was absolutely lovely and the candied caramel was nice too.

Playing in the background they had an old school piano and I think cello thing going on. LIVE and loungy!  I loved that.

I did notice the clientele appeared a little snooty, but don't pay attention to the people...let the establishment pay attention to you!

Pulled up front, just an address no signage, and used valet service. Once inside you could cut the pretentiousness with a knife; host tells us the bar is ""so pretty"" that he just stares at it through his entire shift (??) and our waiter, instead of mentioning any specials, proceeds to tell us how the owner just spent eight million dollars to buy a building two blocks away - still not sure why we would care.

The bar is nice, bright lights and a million bottles, the menu isn't nice. Just a few overpriced entrees that, although expensive, were small.

I ordered a gin martini with stuffed olives and my wife ordered wine. The martini was small and the olives were not fresh. The wine came in a beautiful eight inch glass, but only about two inches of wine.",0

A couple of my friends already had dinner so we just grab drinks by the bar.  I like the atmosphere and the decor but was a tad bit disappointed with the cocktails.  I am a bourbon type of gal.  I like it neat or on the rocks, so that's not very difficult to get wrong however I tasted my friends Moscow mule and it just wasn't it.  I love old fashioned and there's were ok.  Love the live music there.  Great place for date night.  I really hope they get the drinks right and please turn down the AC because it was super hot when we were there.  This place was a place where u are dress to impressed, guys in their blazers and the girls all dolled up.  We were just melting by the end of our first drink.",0

The live music definitely helps the atmosphere.  The gin and tonic was made really well.  I'm not a big fan of gin, and I really liked it.  It is not a quiet restaurant for low intimate conversations.   Overall the food and cocktails were done well .  Our favorite was the grilled octopus.  The black risotto head a great robust flavor with the boar sausage and mushrooms.    The fish of the day was a snapper.  The fish was perfectly cooked,  but not a fan of the vegetable garnish it came with.   The ile flotante was light and fluffy as delicious as I remembered from France.",0

I've been before and loved the food and drink. Came back on a Thursday night to enjoy the lounge for a few drinks. When we arrived, most of the couch seating was marked 'reserved' even though no one ever came to this seating. We were rudely shoo'd off the last available couch seat just as we sat down when  a server came and said it was reserved. I respect that they have a certain biz model, but I would warn that this cool little spot seems to not be very interested in taking care of those who actually show up.",0
yfP9vB26RMeu42ks0OUeZg,1B6S6XDoX1fWnQI0_K1b1Q,2.0,2018-03-05 04:07:04,"This was our second visit to Gin Joint. Our first was a delightful experience, on a Sunday following the opera at the Straz. I had made a reservation online, but when we arrived, there wasn't a record of that and I was advised to call instead. Our waiter, Brooks, was charming & attentive. The food was very good & we enjoyed the jazz combo after dinner. 

Tonight, however, was a disappointment. I called on Sat. night to make a reservation, but got the voicemail of the ""bar manager?""  Strange, I thought, but left a message requesting a 5:00pm reservation. No call back. The following day, still no call, so I called again in the morning. Same vm, left a message, but no call back before or after the performance. Still, we arrive at the restaurant around 5:15, there is no record of our reservation & we are told all tables are booked, but we can sit at one of the lounge tables. These were totally unsuitable for dining, especially because one of our party was physically challenged. I confronted the hostess & told her I had called twice requesting a reservation, had to leave a vm, and never got a return call. She said that they received a lot of voice mails & couldn't possibly answer them all!  I told her that this was unacceptable, that this was our second time there, and we should be treated with greater respect. Suddenly a mgr. intervened and we were escorted to a table. We again had Brooks as our server, who was attentive, but there were long lapses where we were waiting for a second glass of wine & for our check. The risotto I had was over salted, and the oysters came late ( they were very good), but they were supposed to precede the entree. 

This is a good restaurant with a unique atmosphere, but the overall experience was ruined by the inability to respond to a reservation request & the rather haughty and unacceptable reception from the Hostess on our arrival. Someone forgot to tell her that the customer is always right. In this case, the customer will not be returning and will be sure to pass this unfortunate experience along.",0

A Great Meal; Great Date; Great Dinner requires a balance of all the above - Outstanding!

We tried a lot of things. We had the Angeled Eggs, which were diverse and great. My husband got the Caesar salad, which he said was top 10 he's had (that's saying a lot). I got the grilled cheese and a side of greens au gratin for my dinner, the grilled cheese was great and the greens were okay. My husband got the fish of the day, which was Mahi with whipped mashed potatoes, asparagus and a thin and light lemon cream sauce. It was so good! Our drinks were phenomenal and the service was as well. Our waiter Joe was attentive and great for suggestions. Can't wait to go back!",0

Our bartender on our last trip was a true cocktail craftsman. I look forward to going back and having a meal in addition to cocktails. I was recommend reservations.,0
gBz97Y5dzr_aFyvH6f7SbA,1B6S6XDoX1fWnQI0_K1b1Q,4.0,2017-10-08 16:32:49,"I've never liked gin, though I have occasionally found a good bartender who can make an impressive craft cocktail with gin.  However, we found ourselves going to Vault of Souls, and Gin Joint seemed to be the perfect place to start the evening (seeing as how they are literally a door down from each other).  Picture an incredibly classy lounge or speakeasy - or don't picture it and just look at the pictures - and that's what you get with Gin Joint - beautiful chandeliers, classy music, and delicious drinks.

Admittedly, service is a bit slow, but that's what you get at a craft cocktail joint.  The cocktail menu includes a fold-out gin matrix, showing you each brand they carry and where on the flavor spectrum they fall.  They also recommend if you've never had gin, or haven't liked it in the past, to pick a gin and try a gin and tonic, served in a wine glass with a single large ice cube.  I decided to give gin another shot - I don't recall which one I had, but it was close to the orange peel/cinnamon side of the matrix.  Our friend got one that was more citrus-y.  Both ended up being good, but hers was much better.  I'd recommend going for one that has a hint of citrus.  Makes it much smoother.

The only reason I won't give Gin Joint 5 stars is that the food was really nothing special.  We got a cheese board, which Melissa and our friend shared, mussels in a tarragon cream sauce (one of the 3 different ways they serve mussels), and I got brussel sprouts cooked with bacon.  The sprouts were really good, but of course they were - bacon was involved.  However, the mussels were really sub par.  In fairness, maybe I just don't like tarragon cream, but I didn't like them at all.  Melissa and our friend seemed to enjoy the cheese, but Melissa also got Oysters Rockefeller and wasn't impressed.

In the end, Gin Joint is worth checking out.  If you like craft cocktails or want to try some gin, come here.  Not sure I would stay for dinner - I don't think I'll eat here again - but I would definitely come back for drinks.  One thing though - fellas - do me a favor and dress well.  I know the Tampa uniform for dressy is a clean t-shirt and closed toe sandals, but wake up and realize that this is a classy place and guys, t-shirts and jeans make you look like a punk.",1

From the second you approach the door and lobby you're transported to a different time and place where every person working there is dedicated to making you feel like the most important guest in the house.

A group of us decided to stop in for drinks and a late snack.  We were met at the front door by 2 men who were in a word- nasty; no - mean; no - impolite; no - flip; no -  discourteous; no I'll-mannered. We didn't have a reservation since we weren't aware that one was  required.  There is a polite and customer friendly way to inform people of a reservation policy and it is not having 2 men at the door acting like they hold the keys to the kingdom.  If they represent the climate of the ""joint"", we won't be back.  Downtown Tampa is still trying to attract and keep businesses.  If this is the way they treat customers, they will soon find themselves without customers.  I for one will be supporting businesses that act like they care.",2

Let's just say Friday nights and Saturday nights are not the best time to be at CW Gin without a reservation. Without any reservations, options are only at the bar. So you wait in a formed line for who knows how long, then the door man in a white suit lets people in based on what the staff indoors tell him. When you finally make it in, there are no guaranteed bar seats, so you stand and wait a bit longer and hope people with bar seats leave before taking their seats and becoming somewhat comfortable. While seated, you will get desperate stares from other patrons without seats. When you get up to use the bathroom, you walk past the live band to the back, open the door to a tiled alleyway which looks like an asylum. A big contrast from the dim lights and cosy vibe on the inside. Now the food...
The $27 loaded potato was cold and bland. 
The grilled octopus and lobster max and cheese were amazing. Best I've ever had
The highlight was the live music. Great selection of music to go with angelic voices",1
TNfd6RQ6pHHSSiu2x7H8yQ,1B6S6XDoX1fWnQI0_K1b1Q,3.0,2018-01-15 17:39:06,"Food was decent enough. None of the entrees garnered our attention so we made a meal of sharables. The Cuban was really good. Everything else I had seemed like something any other business in town targeting the 20 to 30 year old crowd would have.

They surprisingly don't offer a gin flight. Seems pretty intuitive to have that option. 

Also, the noise. It. Is. So. Loud. It hurts until your ears adjust. They need to do something to absorb some of the sound unless that's some sort of ambiance thing they're going for. There was a jazz band and singer maybe 100ft away and I couldn't tell you one thing they sang or played all night because it was so loud. This would not be a good place to try and socialize with friends or have a large party where you hope to be able to talk. 

I'd go back and at least sit at the bar if they added gin flights. Otherwise, once was enough.",0

We stopped by early on Saturday night. I had tried to get a reservation earlier in the week, but they were booked, so we just figured we would take our chances at the bar.  As luck would have it, we were seated at a high top in between the bar and dining room, and it was perfect.

Our waiter was spot on, with great drink recommendations, and was able to knowledgeably answer questions about the food. We started with a cheese tray - it was an assortment of three, served with crackers, dried apricots, nuts, and a small piece of honeycomb. For my meal I had the catch of the day, mahi mahi. It was perfectly cooked, very flavorful, and served on a bed of asparagus and mashed potatoes. Very good, although a bit expensive. I feel like the menu does need some tweaking; there weren't enough items for just a light meal. I'm still so sad I didn't have room for dessert, because they had a dessert cart that kept traveling by with some amazing looking options on it.

I only had one type of cocktail, but it was so good I ordered it twice.  It was called the Clover Club, made with gin, raspberry syrup, lemon, and egg white froth. It was phenomenal.  Don't let the name of the place fool you, though - they had an extremely extensive list of every alcohol imaginable, including some rare options in every category.

The interior is gorgeous, and I feel like they paid a lot of attention to fine details which made the place unlike most in Tampa: a formally dressed doorman opened the door and greeted us, there was a pianist playing in the lounge, stunning chandeliers were hanging everywhere, and they even had a live grow wall of different greens for salads.  I can't wait to return!",4
