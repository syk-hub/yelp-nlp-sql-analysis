# yelp-nlp-sql-analysis
Exploratory analysis of Yelp reviews using SQL joins, NLP, and visualization.
# Yelp NLP + SQL Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the **Yelp Academic Dataset** to uncover patterns in business reviews and ratings.  
It combines:
- **Structured analysis** (SQL joins, aggregations)
- **Exploratory data analysis** (visualizations, correlations)
- **Basic NLP** (review text cleaning and sentiment scoring)

The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data handling:  
üìä SQL-style joins ‚Üí üêº Pandas transformations ‚Üí üìà Visual storytelling.

# Yelp SQL Capstone Project

This project demonstrates loading and analyzing the [Yelp Academic Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) with PostgreSQL and Python.

## Full Results
Using the full dataset provided by Yelp:
- Businesses loaded: **150,346**
- Coffee & Tea businesses: **6,704**
- Reviews loaded: **X,XXX,XXX** (insert your real number here)

All analysis and insights in the notebook are based on the full dataset.

## Sample Data (for demonstration)
Because the full Yelp dataset is very large (GBs), this repo includes two small CSV files:
- `sample_business.csv` (100 businesses)
- `sample_review.csv` (‚âà300 reviews)

These samples allow anyone to:
- Load the data into PostgreSQL
- Run through the notebook without needing the full dataset
- Validate that the pipeline (ETL, table creation, queries) works correctly

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The sample data is not representative. Counts and results will differ from the full dataset.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repo
2. Install requirements
3. Run the notebook with the sample CSVs **or** download the full Yelp dataset and update the file paths.

## Methods
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Loaded business and review tables.
   - Cleaned columns, derived flags (e.g., Urban vs. Non-Urban).
   - Created a *Predicted vs. Actual Stars (PAS)* metric.

2. **SQL Joins via SQLite**
   - Demonstrated joins between business and reviews.
   - Queried aggregated stats (average stars, review counts).

3. **Analysis**
   - Explored relationships between review count and star rating.
   - Compared ratings across urban vs. non-urban businesses.
   - Identified ‚Äúhidden gems‚Äù outperforming expectations.

4. **Visualization**
   - Boxplots, scatter plots with fitted lines.
   - Ranked bar chart of top businesses by PAS.
